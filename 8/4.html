                    Vaishampayana said, "Hearing this intelligence, O monarch, Dhritarashtra<br>the son of Ambika, feeling the acme of grief, regarded Suyodhana to be<br>already dead. Exceedingly agitated, the king fell down on the Earth like<br>an elephant deprived of its senses. When that foremost of the monarchs,<br>greatly agitated, fell down on the Earth, loud wails were uttered, O best<br>of the Bharatas, by the ladies (of the royal household). That noise was<br>so loud that it seemed to fill the entire Earth. Immersed in a deep ocean<br>of woe, the Bharata ladies, with hearts exceedingly agitated and scorched<br>by grief, wept aloud. Approaching the king, Gandhari, O bull of Bharata's<br>race, and the other ladies of the household, all fell down on the earth,<br>deprived of their senses. Then Sanjaya, O king, began to comfort those<br>ladies stricken with grief, bathed in tears, and reft of consciousness.<br>Comforted (by Sanjaya), those ladies began to tremble repeatedly like a<br>plantain grove shaken by the wind. Vidura also, sprinkling that<br>descendant of Kuru with water, began to comfort the puissant monarch who<br>had knowledge only for his eye. Slowly restored to consciousness, and<br>understanding that the ladies of the household were there, the king, O<br>monarch, remained perfectly silent for some time like one reft of reason.<br>Having reflected then for some time, and repeatedly drawn long breaths,<br>the king censured his own sons and applauded the Pandavas. Censuring also<br>his own intelligence and that of Shakuni the son of Subala, the king,<br>having reflected for a long time, began to tremble repeatedly.<br>Controlling his mind once more, the king, with sufficient fortitude,<br>questioned his charioteer Sanjaya the son of Gavalgana.<br><br>"Dhritarashtra said, 'I have heard, O Sanjaya, all that thou hast said.<br>Hath my son Duryodhana, O Suta, who is ever desirous of victory, already<br>gone to Yama's abode, despairing of success? Tell me truly, O Sanjaya,<br>all this even if thou wilt have to repeat it!'"<br><br>Vaishampayana continued, "Thus addressed by the king, O Janamejaya, the<br>Suta said unto him, 'The mighty car-warrior Vaikartana, O monarch, hath<br>been slain with his sons and brothers, and other Suta warriors, all of<br>whom were mighty bowmen ready to lay down their lives in battle!<br>Duhshasana also hath been slain by the renowned son of Pandu. Indeed, his<br>blood also hath been, from wrath, drunk by Bhimasena in battle!'"
