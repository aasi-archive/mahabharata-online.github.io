                    "Lomasa said, 'The Pitris of those men who, without having wedded wives<br>of their own, betake themselves to the wives of other people, become<br>filled with disappointment when the time for the Sraddhas comes. He who<br>betakes himself to the wives of other people, he who indulges in sexual<br>union with a woman that is barren, and he who appropriates what belongs<br>to a Brahmana, are equally sinful. Without doubt, the Pitris of such<br>people cut them off without desiring to have any intercourse with them.<br>The offerings they make fail to gratify the deities and the Pitris.<br>Hence, one should always abstain from sexual congress with women that are<br>the wedded wives of others, as also with women that are barren. The man<br>who desires his own good should not appropriate what belongs to a<br>Brahmana. Listen now to another mystery, unknown to all with regard to<br>religion. One should, endued with faith, always do the bidding of one's<br>preceptor and other seniors. On the twelfth lunar day, as also on the day<br>of the full moon, every month, one should make gifts unto Brahmanas of<br>ghee and the offerings that constitute Akshata. Listen to me as I say<br>what the measure is of the merit that such a person acquires. By such an<br>act one is said to increase Soma and the Ocean. Vasava, the chief of the<br>celestials, confers upon him a fourth part of the merits that attach to a<br>Horse-sacrifice. By making such gifts, a person becomes endued with great<br>energy and prowess. The divine Soma, well-pleased with him, grants him<br>the fruition of his wishes. Listen now to another duty, together with the<br>foundation on which it rests, that is productive of great merit. In this<br>age of Kali, that duty, if performed, brings about much happiness to men.<br>That man who, rising at early dawn and purifying himself by a bath,<br>attires himself in white robes and with the concentrated attention makes<br>gifts unto Brahmanas of vessels full of sesame seeds, who makes offerings<br>unto the Pitris of water with sesame seeds and honey, and who gives lamps<br>as also the food called Krisara acquires substantial merits. Listen to me<br>as I say what those merits are. The divine chastiser of Paka has ascribed<br>these merits to the gift of vessels of copper and brass filled with<br>sesame seeds. He who makes gifts of kine, he who makes gifts of land that<br>are productive of eternal merit, he who performs the Agnishtoma sacrifice<br>with copious presents in the form of Dakshina to the Brahmanas, are all<br>regarded by the deities as acquiring, merits equal to those which one<br>acquires by making gifts of vessels filled with sesame seeds. Gifts of<br>water with sesame seeds are regarded by the Pitr is as productive of<br>eternal gratification to them. The grandsires all become highly pleased<br>with gifts of lamps and Krisara. I have thus recited the ancient<br>ordinance, laid down by the Rishis, that is highly applauded by both the<br>Pitris and the deities in their respective regions.'"
