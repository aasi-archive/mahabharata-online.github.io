                    "Vayu said, 'I shall recite some duties the observance of which is<br>fraught with happiness to mankind. Do ye listen also with concentrated<br>attention to certain transgressions with the secret causes upon which<br>they depend. That man who offers for the four months of the rainy season<br>sesame and water (unto the Pitris), and food, according to the best of<br>his power, unto a Brahmana well-conversant with the duties, who duly<br>pours libations on the sacred fire, and makes offerings of rice boiled in<br>sugared milk, who gives lamps in honour of the Pitris, with sesame and<br>water,&#8212;verily he who does all this with faith and concentrated attention<br>acquires all the merits that attach to a hundred sacrifices in which<br>animals are offered to the deities. Listen to this other high mystery<br>that is unknown to all. That man who thinks it all right when a Sudra<br>ignites the fire upon which he is to pour libations or who does not see<br>any fault when women who are incompetent to assist at Sraddhas and other<br>rites are allowed to assist at them, really becomes stained with<br>sin<span class="footnote-tooltip" style="color:rgb(255,193,7);"><sup><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i></sup><span class="footnote-tooltip-text">A Brahmana's fire should never be ignited by a Sudra. Women also should never be allowed to assist at Sraddhas for arranging the offerings.  </span></span>. The three sacrificial fires become enraged with such a person.<br>In his next life he has to take birth as a Sudra. His Pitris, together<br>with the deities are never gratified with him. I shall now recite what<br>the expiations are which one must go through for cleansing oneself from<br>such sins. Listen to me with attention. By performing those expiatory<br>acts, one becomes happy and free from fever. Fasting all the while, one<br>should, for three days, with concentrated attention, pour libation, on<br>the sacred fire, of the urine of the cow mixed with cowdung and milk and<br>ghee. The deities accept the offerings of such a man on the expiration of<br>a full year. His Pitris also, when the time comes for him for performing<br>the Sraddha, become gratified with him. I have thus recited what is<br>righteous and what is unrighteous, with all their unknown details, in<br>respect of human beings desirous of attaining to heaven. Verily, men who<br>abstain from these transgressions or who having committed them undergo<br>the expiatory rites indicated, succeed, in attaining to heaven when they<br>leave this world."
