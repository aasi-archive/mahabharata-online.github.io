He, who, without being<br>checked by the restraints of the scriptures, sells a cow, or kills one,<br>or eats the flesh of a cow, or they, who, for the sake of wealth, suffer<br>a person to kill kine,&#8212;all these, viz., he that kills, he that eats, and<br>he that permits the slaughter,&#8212;rot in hell for as many years as there<br>are hairs on the body of the cow so slain.<span class="footnote-tooltip" style="color:rgb(255,193,7);"><sup><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i></sup><span class="footnote-tooltip-text">In verse 3; vikrayartham is followed, as the Commentator rightly explains, by niyunkta or some such word. Vikrayartham hinsyat may mean 'killing for sale.' This, however should be pleonastic with reference to what follows.  </span></span> O thou of great<br>puissance, those faults and those kinds of faults that have been said to<br>attach to one that obstructs a Brahmana's sacrifice, are said to attach<br>to the sale and the theft of kine. That man, who, having stolen a cow<br>makes a gift of her unto a Brahmana, enjoys felicity in heaven as the<br>reward of the gift but suffers misery in hell for the sin of theft for as<br>long a period. Gold has been said to constitute the Dakshina, O thou of<br>great splendour, in gifts of kine. Indeed, gold has been said to be the<br>best Dakshina in all sacrifices. By making a gift of kine one is said to<br>rescue one's ancestors to the seventh degree as also one's descendants to<br>the seventh degree. By giving away kine with Dakshina of gold one rescues<br>one's ancestors and descendants of double the number. The gift of gold is<br>the best of gifts. Gold is, again, the best Dakshina. Gold is a great<br>cleanser, O Sakra, and is, indeed, the best of all cleansing objects. O<br>thou of a hundred sacrifices, gold has been said to be the sanctifier of<br>the entire race of him who gives it away. I have thus, O thou of great<br>splendour, told thee in brief of Dakshina.'<br><br>"Bhishma said, 'Even this was said by the Grandsire unto Indra, O chief<br>of Bharata's race! Indra imparted it unto Dasaratha, and Dasaratha in his<br>turn unto his son Rama, Rama of Raghu's race imparted it unto his dear<br>brother Lakshmana of great fame. While dwelling in the woods, Lakshmana<br>imparted it unto the Rishis. It has then come down from generation to<br>generation, for the Rishis of rigid vows held it amongst themselves as<br>also the righteous kings of the earth. My preceptor, O Yudhishthira,<br>communicated it to me. That Brahmana, who recites it every day in the<br>assemblies of Brahmanas, in sacrifices or at gifts of kine, or when two<br>persons meet together, obtains hereafter many regions of inexhaustible<br>felicity where he always resides with the deities as his companions. The<br>holy Brahman, the Supreme Lord, had said so (unto Indra on the subject of<br>kine).'"
