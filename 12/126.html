                    "Bhishma said, 'The king, having entered that large forest, came upon an<br>asylum of ascetics. Fatigued with the toil he had undergone, he sat<br>himself down for rest. Beholding him armed with bow, worn out with toil,<br>and hungry, the ascetics approached him and honoured him in due form.<br>Accepting the honours offered by the Rishis, the king enquired of them<br>about the progress and advancement of their penances. Having duly<br>answered the enquiries of the king, those Rishis endued with wealth of<br>asceticism asked that tiger among rulers about the reason that led his<br>steps to that retreat. And they said, 'Blessed be thou, in pursuit of<br>what delightful object hast thou, O king, come to this asylum, walking on<br>foot and armed with sword and bow and arrows? We wish to hear whence thou<br>art coming, O giver of honours. Tell us also in what race thou art born<br>and what thy name is.' Thus addressed, O bull among men, the king<br>proceeded to duly give unto all those Brahmanas an account of himself, O<br>Bharata, saying, 'I am born in the race of the Haihayas. By name I am<br>Sumitra, and I am the son of Mitra. I chase herds of deer, slaying them<br>in thousands with my arrows. Accompanied by a large force and my<br>ministers and the ladies of my household, I came out on a hunting<br>expedition. I pierced a deer with an arrow, but the animal with the shaft<br>sticking to his body ran with great speed. In chasing it I have, without<br>a set purpose, arrived at this forest and find myself in your presence,<br>shorn of splendour, toil-worn, and with hope disappointed. What can be<br>more pitiable than this, viz., that I have arrived at this asylum, spent<br>with fatigue, shorn of the signs of royalty, and disappointed of my<br>hopes. I am not at all sorry, ye ascetics, at my being now shorn of the<br>signs of royalty or at my being now at a distance from my capital. I<br>feel, however, a poignant grief in consequence of my hope having been<br>disappointed. The prince of mountains, viz., Himavat, and that vast<br>receptacle of waters, viz., the ocean, cannot, for its vastness, measure<br>the extent of the firmament. Ye ascetics, similarly, I also cannot<br>discern the limit of hope. Ye that are endued with wealth of penances are<br>omniscient. There is nothing unknown to you. You are also highly blessed.<br>I therefore, solicit you for resolving my doubt. Hope as cherished by<br>man, and the wide firmament, which of these two appears vaster to you? I<br>desire to hear in detail what is so unconquerable to hope. If the topic<br>be one upon which it is not improper for ye to discourse, then tell me<br>all about it without delay. I do not wish, ye foremost of regenerate<br>ones, to hear anything from You that may be a mystery improper to<br>discourse upon. If again the discourse be injurious to your penances, I<br>would not wish you to speak. If the question asked by me be a worthy<br>topic of discourse, I would then wish to hear the cause in detail.<br>Devoted to penances as ye are, do ye all instruct me on the subject.'"
