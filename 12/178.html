                            "Bhishma continued, 'In this connection is also cited the old narrative<br>of the verses sung by Janaka the ruler of the Videhas, who had attained<br>to tranquillity of soul. What the monarch said was, 'Unlimited is my<br>wealth. At the same time I have nothing, if the whole of (my kingdom)<br>Mithila be consumed in a conflagration, I shall incur no loss.' In the<br>connection is also cited the speech of Vodhya uttered in respect of this<br>very topic, viz., freedom from attachments. Listen to it O Yudhishthira!<br>Once on a time the royal son of Nahusha (Yayati) questioned the Rishi<br>Vodhya who had, in consequence of the abandonment of desire, attained to<br>tranquillity of soul and who had an intimate acquaintance with the<br>scriptures. The monarch said, 'O thou of great wisdom, give me<br>instructions about tranquillity. What is that under standing relying upon<br>which thou succeedest in wandering over the world in tranquillity of soul<br>and disengaged from all acts?'<br><br>"Vodhya said, 'I conduct myself according to the instructions of others<br>but never instruct others myself. I shall, however, mention the<br>indications of those instructions (according to which my conduct is<br>framed). Thou mayst catch their spirit by reflection. My six preceptors<br>are Pingala, the osprey, the snake, the bee in the forest, the maker of<br>shafts (in the story), and the maiden (in the story)!'<span class="footnote-tooltip" style="color:rgb(255,193,7);"><sup><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i></sup><span class="footnote-tooltip-text">The two lines are antithetical. What is said here is that though there is misery in property, there is no real happiness in affluence. Hence Nilakantha is right in supposing that the last word of the first line is not dhane but adhane the Sandhi being Arsha.  </span></span><br><br>"Bhishma continued, 'Hope is very powerful (in agitating the heart), O<br>King! Freedom from hope is high felicity. Reducing hope to an absence of<br>expectation, Pingala sleeps in peace.<span class="footnote-tooltip" style="color:rgb(255,193,7);"><sup><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i></sup><span class="footnote-tooltip-text">Nilakantha explains that by Saranga here is meant the bee. The anweshanam following it is 'going behind.' The whole compound means 'imitation of the bee in the forest.'  </span></span> Beholding an osprey with meat<br>in his beaks, others, that have not found any meat, assail and destroy<br>him. A certain osprey, by altogether abstaining from meat obtained<br>felicity. To build a house for one's own self is productive of sorrow and<br>not of happiness. The snake, taking up his residence in another<br>creature's abode, lives in felicity. The ascetics live happily, betaking<br>themselves to mendicancy, without being injured by any creature, like<br>bees in the forest. A certain maker of shafts, while employed at his<br>work, was so deeply attentive to it that he did not notice the king who<br>passed by his side. When many are together, dispute ensues. Even when two<br>reside together, they are sure to converse. I, however, wander alone like<br>the anklet made of sea-shells in the wrist of the maiden in the<br>story.'"<span class="footnote-tooltip" style="color:rgb(255,193,7);"><sup><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i></sup><span class="footnote-tooltip-text">The allusion is to the story of Pingala, in Section 74 ante.  </span></span>
