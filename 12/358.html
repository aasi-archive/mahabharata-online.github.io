                    "Bhishma continued, 'The Nagas of that city became exceedingly distressed<br>when they saw that that Brahmana, devoted to the practice of penances,<br>continued to reside in the forest, entirely abstaining all the while from<br>food, in expectation of the arrival of the Naga chief. All the kinsmen<br>and relatives of the great Naga, including his brother and children and<br>wife, assembling together, repaired to the spot where the Brahmana was<br>staying. Arrived on the banks of the Gomati, they beheld that regenerate<br>person seated in a secluded spot, abstaining from food of every kind,<br>observant the while of excellent vows, and engaged in silently reciting<br>certain Mantras. Approaching the presence of the Brahmana and offering<br>him due worship, the kinsmen and relatives of the great Naga said unto<br>him these words fraught with candour:&#8212;O Brahmana, endued with wealth of<br>asceticism, this is the sixth day of thy arrival here, but thou sayest no<br>word about thy food, O regenerate one, thou art devoted to righteousness.<br>Thou hast come to us. We two are here in attendance upon thee. It is<br>absolutely necessary that we should do the duties of hospitality to thee.<br>We are all relations of the Naga chief with whom thou hast business.<br>Roots or fruits, leaves, or water, or rice or meat, O best of Brahmanas,<br>it behoveth thee to take for thy food. In consequence of thy dwelling in<br>this forest under such circumstances of total abstention from food, the<br>whole community of Nagas, young and old, is being afflicted, since this<br>thy fast implies negligence on our part to discharge the duties of<br>hospitality. We have none amongst us that has been guilty of<br>Brahmanicide. None of us has ever lost a son immediately after birth. No<br>one has been born in our race that has eaten before serving the deities<br>or guests or relatives arrived at his residence.<br><br>"The Brahmana said, 'In consequence of these solicitations of you all, I<br>may be regarded to have broken my fast. Eight days are wanting for the<br>day to come when the chief of the Nagas will return.<span class="footnote-tooltip" style="color:rgb(255,193,7);"><sup><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i></sup><span class="footnote-tooltip-text">The commentator explains that nityah-salilah means pure as water. I think this is not the sense of the word here.  </span></span> If, on the<br>expiry of the eighth night hence, the chief of the Nagas does not come<br>back, I shall then break this fast by eating. Indeed, this vow of<br>abstaining from all food that I am observing is in consequence of my<br>regard for the Naga chief. You should not grieve for what I am doing. Do<br>you all return to whence you came. This my vow is on his account. You<br>should not do anything in consequence of which this my vow may be<br>broken.&#8212;The assembled Nagas, thus addressed by the Brahmana, were<br>dismissed by him, whereupon, O foremost of men, they returned to their<br>respective residences.'"
