King Dhritarashtra also of great fame, gave away, for<br>the good of his sons in the other world, excellent food, and kine, and<br>much wealth, and many beautiful and costly gems (unto the Brahmanas).<br>Yudhishthira accompanied by Draupadi, gave much wealth for the sake of<br>Drona and the high-souled Karna, of Dhrishtadyumna and Abhimanyu, of the<br>Rakshasa Ghatotkacha, the son of Hidimva, and of Virata, and his other<br>well-wishers that had served him loyally, and of Drupada and the five<br>sons of Draupadi. For the sake of each of these, the king gratified<br>thousands of Brahmanas with gifts of wealth and gems, and kine and<br>clothes. The king performed the Sraddha rite for the good in the next<br>world, of every one of those kings also who had fallen in the battle<br>without leaving kinsmen or friends behind. And the king also, for the<br>good of the souls of all his friends, caused houses to be founded for the<br>distribution of food, and places for the distribution of water, and tanks<br>to be excavated in their names. Thus paying off the debt he owed to them<br>and avoiding the chance of censure in the world,<span class="footnote-tooltip" style="color:rgb(255,193,7);"><sup><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i></sup><span class="footnote-tooltip-text">For if he had acted otherwise, he would have been called ungrateful.  </span></span> the king became<br>happy and continued to protect his subjects religiously. He showed due<br>honour, as before, unto Dhritarashtra, and Gandhari, and Vidura, and unto<br>all the superior Kauravas and unto all the officers. Full of kindness,<br>the Kuru king honoured and protected all those ladies also who had, in<br>consequence of the battle, been deprived of their heroic husbands and<br>sons. The puissant king, with great compassion, extended his favours to<br>the destitute and the blind and the helpless by giving them food, clothes<br>and shelter. Freed from foes and having conquered the whole Earth, king<br>Yudhishthira began to enjoy great happiness.'"
