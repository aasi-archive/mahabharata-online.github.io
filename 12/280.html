                    "Usanas said, 'I bow to that divine and illustrious and puissant Being<br>who holds this earth with the firmament in his arms. I shall speak to<br>thee of the pre-eminent greatness of that Vishnu whose head, O best of<br>the Danavas, is that Infinite place (called Emancipation).'<br><br>"While they were thus conversing with each other there came unto them the<br>great sage Sanatkumara of righteous soul for the purpose of dispelling<br>their doubts. Worshipped by the prince of Asuras and by the sage Usanas,<br>that foremost of sages sat down on a costly seat. After Kumara of great<br>wisdom had been seated (at his ease), Usanas said unto him, 'Discourse to<br>this chief of the Danavas on the pre-eminent greatness of Vishnu.'<br>Hearing these words, Sanatkumara uttered the following, fraught with<br>grave import, upon the pre-eminent greatness of Vishnu unto the<br>intelligent chief of the Danavas, 'Listen, O Daitya, to everything about<br>the greatness of Vishnu. Know, O scorcher of foes, that the entire<br>universe rests on Vishnu. O thou of mighty arms, it is He who creates all<br>creatures mobile and immobile. In course of Time it is He, again, who<br>withdraws all things and in Time it is He who once more casts them forth<br>from Himself. Into Hari all things merge at the universal destruction and<br>from Him all things again come forth. Men possessed of scriptural lore<br>cannot obtain him by such lore. Nor can He be obtained by Penances, nor<br>by Sacrifices. The only means by which He can be attained is by<br>restraining the Senses. Nor that sacrifices are entirely useless towards<br>such an end. For one, by relying upon both external and internal acts,<br>and upon one's own mind, can purify (them) by one's own understanding. By<br>such means, one succeeds in enjoying infinity in the world.<span class="footnote-tooltip" style="color:rgb(255,193,7);"><sup><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i></sup><span class="footnote-tooltip-text">Penances are meritorious. The very sight of Hari that I obtain was as efficacious as a course of the austerest penances. Of course, in consequence of that and my other penances great have been the rewards that I have enjoyed. It seems, however, that the full measure of rewards has not been reaped; the remnant is to be enjoyed by me now, for I am about to ask thee about the fruits of acts. Sacred and highly auspicious is my enquiry. To make it is, in itself, a reward.  </span></span> As a<br>goldsmith purifies the dross of his metal by repeatedly casting it into<br>the fire with very persistent efforts of his own, after the same manner<br>Jiva succeeds in cleaning himself by his course through hundreds of<br>births. Some one may be seen to purify himself in only one life by mighty<br>efforts. As one should with care wipe stains from off one's person before<br>they become thick, after the same manner one should, with vigorous<br>efforts, wash off one's faults.<span class="footnote-tooltip" style="color:rgb(255,193,7);"><sup><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i></sup><span class="footnote-tooltip-text">Vaya acts are, of course, sacrifices and other religious acts; by abhyantara acts are meant santi, danti, uparati, titiksha, and samadhi, i.e., the usual course of mental training necessary for Yoga. What the speaker intends to lay down in this verse is that sacrifices are not entirely useless. These may lead to chitta-suddhi or the cleansing of the heart, which, when attained, leads to knowledge of Him or the Soul or to Emancipation or Infinity.  </span></span> By mixing only a few flowers with<br>them, grains of sesame cannot be made to cast off their own odour (and<br>become at once fragrant). After the same manner, one cannot, by cleansing<br>one's heart only a little, succeed in beholding the Soul. When, however,<br>those grains are perfumed repeatedly with the aid of a large quantity of<br>flowers, it is then that they cast off their own odour and assume that of<br>the flowers with which they are mixed. After this manner, faults, in the<br>form of attachments to all our environments, are dispelled by the<br>understanding in course of many lives, with the aid of a large dose of<br>the attribute of the Sattwa, and by means of efforts born of<br>practice.<span class="footnote-tooltip" style="color:rgb(255,193,7);"><sup><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i></sup><span class="footnote-tooltip-text">The comparison lies in the fact of the desirability of the two acts. No one likes the stains the body may catch to remain unwashed or unwiped off. Similarly, no one should neglect to wash off the faults that the heart may catch. There is no comparison between the two acts with regard to the degree of effort necessary to accomplish each.  </span></span> Listen, O Danava, by what means creatures attached to<br>acts and those unattached to them attain the causes that lead to their<br>respective states of mind.<span class="footnote-tooltip" style="color:rgb(255,193,7);"><sup><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i></sup><span class="footnote-tooltip-text">'Efforts born of practice' refer to both external and internal Sadhana.  </span></span> Listen to me with undivided attention. I<br>shall, in their due order, discourse to thee, O puissant Danava, as to<br>how creatures betake themselves to action and how they give up<br>action.<span class="footnote-tooltip" style="color:rgb(255,193,7);"><sup><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i></sup><span class="footnote-tooltip-text">Karmaviseshan is explained by the commentator as equivalent to ragaviraga-hetun.  </span></span> The Supreme Lord creates all creatures mobile and immobile.<br>He is without beginning and without end. Unendued with attributes of any<br>kind, he assumes attributes (when he chooses to create). He is the<br>universal Destroyer, the Refuge of all things, the Supreme Ordainer, and<br>pure Chit.<span class="footnote-tooltip" style="color:rgb(255,193,7);"><sup><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i></sup><span class="footnote-tooltip-text">Sampravartante and tishthanti are thus explained by the commentator.  </span></span> In all creatures it is He who dwells as the mutable and<br>the immutable.

In this and the following ones, he speaks of the object to be known. Sreeman is explained as asriyate iti srih, i.e., upadhih, tadvan. Hari is Sambharata. Narayana is saravasrayah. Prabhu is sarvaniyanta. Deva is dyotate-iti i.e., Chinmatrah. These etymologies must be grasped for understanding this verse.  </span></span> Know that the Earth is His<br>feet. His head is constituted by Heaven. His arms, O Daitya, are the<br>several points of the compass or the horizon. The intermediate space is<br>His ears. The light of His eye is the Sun, and His mind is in the Moon.<br>His understanding dwells always in Knowledge, and His tongue is in<br>Water.<span class="footnote-tooltip" style="color:rgb(255,193,7);"><sup><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i></sup><span class="footnote-tooltip-text">The 'mutable' in all creatures is the combination of the five primal essences. The 'immutable' in them is Jiva, or Chit as invested with ignorance. The eleven modifications that constitute. His essence are the eleven senses of knowledge and action with the mind. Equipped with these eleven. He drinketh the universe, i.e., enjoys it. The rays are these senses themselves. Equipped with the senses. He enjoys the universe with the senses.  </span></span> O best of Danavas, the Planets are in the midst of His<br>brows. The starts and constellations are from the light of His eyes. The<br>Earth is in His feet. O Danava! Know also that the attributes of Rajas,<br>Tamas, and Sattwa are of Him. He is the fruit (or end) of all the modes<br>of life, and He it is who should be known as the fruit (or reward) of all<br>(pious) acts (such as Japa and Sacrifice, etc.).<span class="footnote-tooltip" style="color:rgb(255,193,7);"><sup><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i></sup><span class="footnote-tooltip-text">'His mind is _in_ the Moon.' i.e., His mind is the Moon.

The Chandas<br>are the hair on His body, and Akshara (or Pranava) is His word. The<br>diverse orders (of men) and the modes of life are His refuge. His mouths<br>are many.

Although the<br>Ritwijes seem to behold Him as separate, He is, however, known to them as<br>one and the same.

When a living creature<br>realises this unity in consequence of true knowledge, he is then said to<br>attain to Brahma. The period of time for which one creation exists or for<br>which if ceases to exist is called a Kalpa. Living creatures exist for a<br>thousand millions of such Kalpas. Immobile creatures also exist for an<br>equal period. The period for which a particular creation exists is<br>measured by many thousands of lakes (in the following way), O Daitya!<br>Conceive a lake that is one Yojana in width, one Krosa in depth, and five<br>hundred Yojanas in length. Imagine many thousands of such lakes. Seek<br>then to dry up those lakes by taking from them, only once a day, as much<br>water as may be taken up with the end of a single hair. The number of<br>days would pass in drying them up completely by this process represents<br>the period that is occupied by the life of one creation from its first<br>start to the time of its destruction.<span class="footnote-tooltip" style="color:rgb(255,193,7);"><sup><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i></sup><span class="footnote-tooltip-text">Verse 21 to 23 show the unity of the Divine Being. The variety perceived is only apparent, not real.  </span></span> The highest Evidence (for all<br>things) says that creatures have six colours, viz., Dark, Tawny, Blue,<br>Red, Yellow, and White. These colours proceed from mixtures in various<br>proportions of the three attributes of Rajas, Tamas, and Sattwa. Where<br>Tamas predominates, Sattwa falls below the mark, and Rajas keeps to the<br>mark, the result is the colour called Dark. When Tamas predominates as<br>before, but the relations between Sattwa and Rajas are reversed, the<br>result is the colour called Tawny. When Rajas predominates, Sattwa falls<br>below the mark, and Tamas keeps to the mark, the result is the colour<br>called Blue. When Rajas predominates as before and the proportion is<br>reversed between Sattwa and Tamas, the result is the intermediate colour<br>called Red. That Colour is more agreeable (than the preceding one). When<br>Sattwa predominates, Rajas falls below the mark and, Tamas keeps to the<br>mark, the result is the colour called Yellow. It is productive of<br>happiness. When Sattwa predominates and the proportion is reversed<br>between Rajas and Tamas, the result is the colour called White. It is<br>productive of great happiness.<span class="footnote-tooltip" style="color:rgb(255,193,7);"><sup><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i></sup><span class="footnote-tooltip-text">Verse 31 and 32 are not difficult; yet the Burdwan translator makes nonsense of the same.  </span></span> The White is the foremost colour. It<br>is sinless in consequence of its being free from attachment and aversion.<br>It is without grief, and free from the toil involved in Pravritti. Hence,<br>White, O prince of Danavas, leads to success (or Emancipation). Jiva, O<br>Daitya, having undergone thousands of births derived through the womb,<br>attains to success.<span class="footnote-tooltip" style="color:rgb(255,193,7);"><sup><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i></sup><span class="footnote-tooltip-text">This is elaborated in the Vishnu Purana, Part I, Sec. V. There are three primary creations, viz., Mahat, the five primal essences in their subtile forms and the senses. From the Six colours again six other creations have sprung. To the Dark colour is due all immobile creatures; to the Tawny all the intermediate order of creatures (viz., the lower animals and birds, etc.); to the Blue are due human beings, to the Red the Prajapatyas; to the Yellow the deities; and to the White are due the Kumara, i.e., Sanatkumara and others.  </span></span> That success is the identical end which the<br>divine Indra declared after having studied many auspicious spiritual<br>treatises and which has for its essence the apprehension of the Soul. The<br>end again that creatures obtain is dependent oil their colour, and<br>colour, in its turn, depends upon the character of the Time that sets in,<br>O Daitya!<span class="footnote-tooltip" style="color:rgb(255,193,7);"><sup><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i></sup><span class="footnote-tooltip-text">Emancipation is so difficult.  </span></span> The stages of existence, O Daitya, through which Jiva<br>must pass are not unlimited. They are fourteen hundreds of thousands ill<br>number. In consequence of them Jiva ascends, stays, and falls down as the<br>case may be.<span class="footnote-tooltip" style="color:rgb(255,193,7);"><sup><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i></sup><span class="footnote-tooltip-text">The construction of the first line is this: subham darsanam (auspicious scriptures) gatwa (prapya) Devah yam gatim (identical with) darsanam (atmanubhavatmikam) aha, Gati is naturally dependent on Varna, and Varna upon 'Time or acts.'  </span></span> The end that is attained by a Jiva of dark flue is<br>very low, for he becomes addicted to acts that lead to hell and then has<br>to rot in hell.<span class="footnote-tooltip" style="color:rgb(255,193,7);"><sup><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i></sup><span class="footnote-tooltip-text">There are ten senses of knowledge and action. To this must be added Manas, Buddhi, Ahankara and Chitta, which are sometimes called the four Karanas. In consequence of these fourteen, fourteen different kinds or merit and demerit may be achieved by Jiva who is their possessor. These fourteen kinds of merit and demerit also, are subdivided into hundreds of thousands each. Jiva, in course of his wanderings through the universe, ascends in the scale of Being, stays in particular rungs, and falls down from them into lower rungs, accordingly, What the speaker wishes to inculcate is that these fourteen should always be towards the attribute of Sattwa or Goodness.  </span></span> The learned say that in consequence of his<br>wickedness, the continuance (in such form) of a Jiva is measured by many<br>thousands of Kalpas.<span class="footnote-tooltip" style="color:rgb(255,193,7);"><sup><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i></sup><span class="footnote-tooltip-text">This life, it should be noted, leadeth to Jiva's transformation as an immobile object. A creature of Dark hue becomes addicted to wicked acts and rots in hell His existence as an immobile object is hell itself.  </span></span> Having passed many hundred thousands of years<br>in that condition, Jiva then attains to the colour called Tawny (and<br>becomes born as an intermediate creature). In that condition he dwells<br>(for many long years), in perfect helplessness. At last when his sins are<br>exhausted (in consequence of his having endured all the misery they are<br>capable of bringing), his mind, casting off all attachments, cherishes<br>Renunciation.<span class="footnote-tooltip" style="color:rgb(255,193,7);"><sup><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i></sup><span class="footnote-tooltip-text">Prajavisargah is the period for which one Creation lasts, being equal to what is called a Kalpa.  </span></span> When Jiva becomes endued with the quality of Sattwa,<br>he then dispels everything connected with Tamas by the aid of his<br>intelligence, and exerts (for achieving what is for his good). As the<br>result of this, Jiva attains to the colour called Red. If the quality of<br>Sattwa, however, be not gained, Jiva then travels in a round of rebirths<br>in the world of inert, having attained to the colour called Blue.<span class="footnote-tooltip" style="color:rgb(255,193,7);"><sup><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i></sup><span class="footnote-tooltip-text">The Dark and the Tawny hues of their corresponding states of existence, viz., the immobile and the intermediate, are regarded as states of endurance. Hence, when the misery that is their portion has been fully endured, the recollection is suddenly irradiated into the mind, of the righteousness that distinguished Jiva in ages far remote. Anisa is helpless or cheerless.  </span></span><br>Having attained to that end (viz., Humanity) and having been afflicted<br>for the duration of one creation by the bonds born of his own acts, Jiva<br>then attains to the colours called Yellow (or becomes a Deity). Existing<br>in that condition for the space of a hundred creations, he then leaves it<br>(for becoming a human being) to return to it once more.<span class="footnote-tooltip" style="color:rgb(255,193,7);"><sup><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i></sup><span class="footnote-tooltip-text">Cha at the end of the second line is equivalent to va. Unless cha be taken as equivalent to va the verse would yield no meaning. After Tawny comes Blue, i.e., after attainment of existence as an Intermediate creature Jiva attains to humanity. This occurs when Sattwa does not predominate. Hence anyatha should be supplied after upaiti.  </span></span> Having<br>attained to the Yellow colour, Jiva exists for thousands of Kalpas,<br>sporting as a Deva. Without, however, being emancipated (even then), he<br>has to stay in hell, enjoying or enduring the fruits of his acts of past<br>Kalpas and wandering through nine and ten thousand courses.<span class="footnote-tooltip" style="color:rgb(255,193,7);"><sup><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i></sup><span class="footnote-tooltip-text">Vyatite is a finite verb in indicative mood, as pointed out by the commentator. It comes from root i with suffix vi. After sate supply jate sati. The Burdwan translator takes it as a participial adjective in the locative singular, which is, of course, wrong. The version he gives of this line is most ridiculous, containing as it does a self-contradictory assertion. K. P. Singha gives the right meaning.  </span></span> Know<br>that Jiva becomes freed from the hell (of acts) as represented by heaven<br>or godship. After the same manner, Jiva gets, off from the other births<br>(corresponding with the other colours). Jiva sports for many long Kalpas<br>in the world of Devas. Falling thence, he once more obtains the status of<br>Humanity. He then stays in that condition for the space of a hundred and<br>eight Kalpas. He then attains once more to the status of a Deva. If while<br>in the status of humanity (for the second time) he falleth through (evil<br>acts as represented by) Kala (in the form of Kali), he then sinks into<br>the Dark colour and thus occupies the very lowest of all stages of<br>existence.<br><br>"I shall tell thee now, O foremost of Asuras, how Jiva succeeds in<br>effecting his Emancipation. Desirous of Emancipation, Jiva, relying upon<br>seven hundred kinds of acts every one of which is characterised by a<br>predominance of the attribute of Sattwa, gradually courses through Red<br>and Yellow and at last attains to White. Arrived here, Jiva travels<br>through several regions that are most adorable and that have the Eight<br>well-known regions of felicity beneath them, and all the while pursues<br>that stainless and effulgent form of existence which is Emancipation's<br>self.<span class="footnote-tooltip" style="color:rgb(255,193,7);"><sup><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i></sup><span class="footnote-tooltip-text">When Jiva becomes a Deva, he has still the ten senses, the five Pranas, and the four internal possessions of mind, understanding, Chitta, and Ahankara, amounting in all to nineteen. These nineteen impel him to thousands of acts. Hence, even when transformed into Deva, Jiva is _not_ freed from acts, but is in niraya or hell,--acts being, under all circumstances, equivalent to hell.  </span></span> Know that the Eight (already referred to and) which are<br>identical with the Sixty (subdivided into) hundreds, are, unto those that<br>are highly effulgent, only creations of the mind (without having any real<br>or independent existence). The highest object of acquisition with one<br>that is White of hue, is that condition (called Turiya) which transcends<br>the three other states of consciousness, viz., Wakefulness and Dream and<br>Dreamless slumber.<span class="footnote-tooltip" style="color:rgb(255,193,7);"><sup><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i></sup><span class="footnote-tooltip-text">Vyuha implies the varied forms of one and the same thing Daivani in Sattwa-pradhanani. The five senses, with the mind, the understanding form a total of seven. The acts achieved through each of these may be subdivided a hundredfold. As these seven possessions adhere to Jiva till he becomes emancipated, he acts through these seven in a variety of ways, Relying, therefore, upon these seven hundred kinds of acts (which are but varied forms of one and the same thing, viz., Action), Jiva successively becomes Red and Yellow and White. Arrived at White, he courses through certain highly effulgent regions which are superior to the region of Brahman himself, and which leave behind or beneath them the Eight Puris (by which, perhaps, is meant the puri of Indra, that of Varuna, etc., or, Kasi, Mathura, Maya, etc., or symbolical stages of progress, which are fraught with great felicity). Those highly effulgent and adorable regions are obtainable by Knowledge alone or the fruit of Yoga.  </span></span> As regards that Yogin who is unable to abandon<br>the felicities that Yoga-puissance brings about, he has to dwell (in one<br>and the same body) for one century of Kalpas in auspiciousness and after<br>that in four other regions (called Mahar, Jana, Tapas, and Satya). Even<br>that is the highest end of one belonging to the sixth colour, and who is<br>Unsuccessful though crowned with success, and who has transcended all<br>attachments and passions.<span class="footnote-tooltip" style="color:rgb(255,193,7);"><sup><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i></sup><span class="footnote-tooltip-text">This is an exceedingly abstruse verse. The Burdwan version, in which unconnected bits of the commentary have been jumbled together, is utter nonsense. K.P. Singha skips over nearly the whole verse. The Eight puris referred to in the previous verse are here stated to be identical with the Sixty well-known incidents of even Sukla or White existence. This tale of Sixty is arrived at in this way: 1st, the state of wakefulness; 2nd, the gross body made up of the five primal essences; 3rd, the five attributes of sound, scent, form, taste, and touch; these come up to seven. Then come the ten senses of action and knowledge; the five breaths; mind, understanding, consciousness, and chitta: these form </span></span> That Yogin, again, who falls off from<br>Yoga practices after having attained the measure of eminence described<br>already resides in heaven for a century of Kalpas with the, unexhausted<br>remnant of his past acts (to be exhausted by enjoyment or endurance as<br>the case may be), and with the seven (viz., the five senses of knowledge<br>and mind and understanding) purged of all stains in consequence of their<br>predisposition or proneness towards the attribute of Sattwa. And the<br>expiry of that period, such a person has to come to the world of men<br>where he attains to great eminence.<span class="footnote-tooltip" style="color:rgb(255,193,7);"><sup><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i></sup><span class="footnote-tooltip-text">Then come Avidya, Kama, and Karma. With Soul or the Beholder, the sum comes up to 30. The number becomes doubled when the state of Dream is taken into consideration, for like Wakefulness existing with the 29, Dream also exists with the 29. With those that are effulgent, i.e., with Beings that are Sukla or White, these 60 are simply mano-viruddhani or manomatrani eva. Unlike other Beings in lower spheres of existence, they that are effulgent or Sukla do not regard the states of Wakefulness and Dream as different but as the same. Hence, the para gati of such Beings is a state of existence that transcends both Wakefulness and Dream, and transcends Dreamless slumber also (for in Dreamless slumber the 30 exist suspended, to be revived with the return of wakefulness), and is identical with the fourth state called Turiya.  </span></span> Turning back from the world of<br>men, he departs for attaining to new forms of existence that run higher<br>and higher in the upward scale. While engaged in this, he courseth<br>through seven regions for seven times, his puissance being always<br>increased in consequence of his Samadhi and the re-awakening from<br>it.<span class="footnote-tooltip" style="color:rgb(255,193,7);"><sup><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i></sup><span class="footnote-tooltip-text">What the speaker wishes to lay down here is that even he that is Jivanmukta or has achieved his Emancipation though living like other, is incapable of transcending the effects of his past acts. Every kind of existence or life (save that which is identical with Brahma) is anistha or inauspiciousness. That Yogin who is Jivan-mukta but who is not able to cast off the felicities of Yoga-puissance, resides in one and the same body for a full century of Kalpas, in a superior form of life, and after the expiry, of that century of Kalpas, he passes through four other regions named Mahar, Jana, Tapas, and Satya. Now, _this_ is the end of such a Yogin, who, of course, belongs to the sixth colour which is White, and who is freed from attachments and who is unsuccessful though successful, i.e., who has achieved Yoga-success but who has not still been able to achieve that success which consists in beholding Brahma or Brahma-sakshatkara. By anisah in this verse is meant that Yogin who is incapable of casting off the felicities brought about by Yoga-puissance. K.P. Singha gives the substance of the verse not very accurately. The Burdwan translator, in the version he gives, introduces three nominatives in the three sentences into which he splits it, viz., Jiva, the Yogin who is unable to cast off the felicities brought about by Yoga-puissance, and the Yogin who has achieved Brahma-sakshatkara, without understanding that all three refer to one and the same person.  </span></span> The Yogin who is desirous of final Emancipation suppresses by<br>Yoga-knowledge the seven, and continues to dwell in the world of life,<br>freed from attachments; and taking those seven for certain means of<br>grief, he casts them off and attains afterwards to that state which is<br>Indestructible and Infinite. Some say that that is the region of<br>Mahadeva; some, of Vishnu; some, of Brahman; some, of Sesha; some, of<br>Nara; some, of the effulgent Chit; and some, of the All-pervading.<span class="footnote-tooltip" style="color:rgb(255,193,7);"><sup><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i></sup><span class="footnote-tooltip-text">Anisah here means one who, after having attained to eminence by Yoga, falls off from Yoga. Tatra means heaven or the superior regions that are his in consequence of Yoga-eminence. For a century of Kalpas such a person has to dwell in heaven, with the unexhausted remnant of his senses, i.e., the senses of knowledge with mind and understanding, being always predisposed towards the attribute of Sattwa. Upon the expiry of that century of Kalpas, such a person, without ascending, descends to the world of men, but then here eminence of station becomes his.  </span></span><br>When universal destruction comes, those persons who have succeeded in<br>completely consuming by Knowledge their gross and subtle and karana<br>bodies, always enter into Brahma. All their Senses also which have action<br>for their essence and which are not identical with Brahma, merge into the<br>same. When the time of universal destruction comes, those Jivas who have<br>attained to the position of Devas and who have an unexhausted remnant of<br>the fruits of acts to enjoy or endure, revert to those stages of life in<br>the subsequent Kalpa which had been theirs in the previous one. This is<br>due to the similarity of every successive Kalpa to every previous one.<br>Those again whose acts, at the time of universal destruction, have been<br>exhausted by enjoyment or endurance in respect of their fruits, falling<br>down from heaven, take birth among men, in the subsequent Kalpa, for<br>without Knowledge one cannot destroy one's acts in even a hundred Kalpas.<br>All superior Beings again, endued with similar powers and similar forms,<br>revert to their respective destinies at a new creation after a universal<br>destruction, ascending and descending precisely in the same manner as<br>during the creation that is dissolved.<span class="footnote-tooltip" style="color:rgb(255,193,7);"><sup><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i></sup><span class="footnote-tooltip-text">Saptakritwah is seven times. Paraiti is 'courseth through.' Lokah refers to the seven regions called respectively, Bhur, Bhuvar, Sivah, Mahar, Jana, Tapas, and Satya (or Brahmaloka). What is intended to be said here is this: If the Yogin, having attained to only the first stage of Yoga, dies, he ascends to heaven. Thence failing down on Earth, he becomes an Emperor and thus conquers the Earth or Bhu. In this way, as the Yogin gradually ascends in the path of Yoga, he ascends higher and higher. In this verse Sambarevikshepa has been used to signify Samadhi and awakening from Samadhi, for in the first the universe is destroyed, and in the second it is re-created. At the end, he reaches the region of Satya or Brahma. Thence even he has to return if he has not been able to achieve Brahma-sakshatkara.  </span></span> As regards, again, the<br>person who is conversant with Brahma, as long as he continues to enjoy<br>and endure the unexhausted remnant of his acts of previous Kalpas, it is<br>said that all creatures and the two stainless sciences live in his body.<br>When his Chitta becomes cleansed by Yoga, and when he practises Samyama,<br>this perceptible universe appears to him as only his own fivefold<br>senses.<span class="footnote-tooltip" style="color:rgb(255,193,7);"><sup><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i></sup><span class="footnote-tooltip-text">The seven that the Yogin desirous of Emancipation casts off are either the seven regions already referred to viz., Bhu, Bhuva, Swah, Maha, Jana, Tapa, and Satya, or the five senses of knowledge with mind and understanding. Samharam is equivalent to Samhritya, having been formed by the suffix namul. Upaplavoni are sources of grief or misfortune. The first Devasya refers to Mahadeva. The Saivas call that region Kailasa. The Vaishnavas call it Vaikuntha. The Hiranya-garbhas call it Brahman's or Brahmaloka. Sesha is Ananta, a particular form of Narayana. They who call it the region of Nara are, of course, the Sankhyas, for these regard Emancipation as the goal of Jiva or every creature. The Devasya vishnoh (in the third line) is Dyotamanasya Brahmanah i.e., Chinmatrasya, or of the pure Chit when uninvested with ignorance or Avidya. The Aupanishadas regard it as the region of Para-Brahma. The commentator clearly points out what the seven regions are. K.P. Singha, misunderstanding the verse, mentions only five; the Burdwan translator six.  </span></span> Enquiring with a cleansed mind, Jiva attains to a high and<br>stainless end. Thence he attains to a spot which knows no deterioration,<br>and thence attains to eternal Brahma that is so difficult of<br>acquisition.<span class="footnote-tooltip" style="color:rgb(255,193,7);"><sup><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i></sup><span class="footnote-tooltip-text">This verse is not at all difficult; yet the Burdwan translator makes utter nonsense of it. K.P. Singha gives the substance of the first line, but skips over the second. Without giving a literal version of the first line, I expand it, following the lead of the commentator.  </span></span> Thus, Of thou of great might, I have discoursed to<br>thee of the eminence of Narayana!'<br><br>"Vritra said, 'These words of thine, I see, perfectly according with the<br>truth. Indeed, when this is so, I have no (cause of grief). Having<br>listened to thy words, O thou of great powers of mind, I have become<br>freed from sorrow and sin of every kind. O illustrious Rishi, O holy one,<br>I see this wheel of Time, endued with mighty energy, of the most<br>effulgent and Infinite Vishnu, has been set in motion. Eternal is that<br>station, from which all kinds of creation spring. That Vishnu is the<br>Supreme Soul. He is the foremost of Beings. In Him this entire universe<br>rests.'<br><br>"Bhishma continued, 'Having said these words, O son of Kunti, Vritra cast<br>off his life-breaths, uniting his soul (in Yoga, with the supreme Soul),<br>and attained to the highest station.'<br><br>"Yudhishthira said, 'Tell me, O grandsire, whether this Janardana<br>(Krishna) is that illustrious and puissant Lord of whom Sanatkumara spoke<br>unto Vritra in days of old.'<br><br>"Bhishma said, 'The Highest Deity, endued with the six attributes of<br>(puissance, etc.) is at the Root. Staying there, the Supreme Soul, with<br>his own energy, creates all these diverse existent things.<span class="footnote-tooltip" style="color:rgb(255,193,7);"><sup><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i></sup><span class="footnote-tooltip-text">Sa here indicates the person conversant with Brahma. The construction is Sa yavat saseshabhuk asti tavat prajah tathaiva te sukle dyvyau cha tadangeshu (vartante). Etat in the second line is this paridrisyamanam viyadadi. What the speaker wishes to inculcate in this verse is that unto one conversant with Brahma, the whole universe up to complete identity with Brahma is as contiguous as a plum in the palm of the hand. When the Chitta is cleansed by Yoga as practised by Dhyana, Dharana, and Samadhis, then the perceptible universe appears to him as identical with his own senses. The two white sciences referred to are Paravidya and Aparavidya, i.e., all knowledge including that of Brahma.  </span></span> Know<br>that this Kesava who knows no deterioration is from His eighth portion.<br>Endued with the highest Intelligence, it is this Kesava who creates the<br>three worlds with an eighth portion (of His energy). Coming immediately<br>after Him who lies at the Root, this Kesava who is eternal (compared with<br>all other existent things), changes at the end of each Kalpa. He,<br>however, who lies at the Root and who is endued with supreme might and<br>puissance, lies in the waters when universal destruction comes (in the<br>form of the potential Seed of all things). Kesava is that Creator of pure<br>Soul who courseth through all the eternal worlds.<span class="footnote-tooltip" style="color:rgb(255,193,7);"><sup><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i></sup><span class="footnote-tooltip-text">Suddhena manasa,--with cleansed mind, i.e., with the aid of Sarvana (hearing), Manana (attention), Dhyana (contemplation), and Abhyasa (repeated meditation). Two stages are indicated in this verse. The first is the attention of the suddham and paramam gatim or the stainless and high end. This is equivalent to Brahma-sakshatkara. After this comes the second stage, which is the avayam sthanam or the spot which knows no deterioration, i.e., Emancipation. This is identical with the attainment of Eternal Brahma which is dushprapyam or difficult of attainment.  </span></span> Infinite and<br>Eternal as He is, He fills all space (with emanations from Himself) and<br>courseth through the universe (in the form of everything that constitutes<br>the universe). Freed as He is from limitations of every kind such as the<br>possession of attributes would imply, he suffers himself to be invested<br>with Avidya and awakened to Consciousness, Kesava of Supreme Soul creates<br>all things. In Him rests this wondrous universe in its entirety.'<br><br>"Yudhishthira said, 'O thou that art conversant with the highest object<br>of knowledge, I think that Vritra saw beforehand the excellent end that<br>awaited him. It is for this, O grandsire, that he was happy and did not<br>yield to grief (in view of his coming Death). He who is White of hue, who<br>has taken birth in a pure or stainless race, and who has attained to the<br>rank of a Sadhya, doth not, O sinless one, come back (into the world for<br>re-birth). Such a person, O grandsire, is freed from both hell and the<br>status of all intermediate creatures. He, however, who has attained to<br>either the Yellow or the Red hue, is seen sometimes to be overwhelmed by<br>Tamas and fall among the order of Intermediate creatures. As regards<br>ourselves, we are exceedingly afflicted and attached to objects that are<br>productive of sorrow or indifference or joy. Alas, what will the end be<br>to which we shall attain? Will it be the Blue or the Dark which is the<br>lowest of all hues?'<br><br>"Bhishma continued, 'Ye are Pandavas. Ye have been born in a stainless<br>race. Ye are of rigid vows. Having sported in joy in the regions of the<br>gods, ye shall come back to the world of men. Living happily as long as<br>the creation lasts, all of you at the next new creation will be admitted<br>among the gods, and enjoying all kinds of felicities ye will at last be<br>numbered among the Siddhas. Let no fear be yours. Be you cheerful.'"
