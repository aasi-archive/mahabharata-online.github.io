                            "Tuladhara said, 'See with thy own eyes, O Jajali, who, viz., those that<br>are good or those that are otherwise, have adopted this path of duty that<br>I have spoken of. Thou shalt then understand properly how the truth<br>stands. Behold, many birds are hovering in the sky. Amongst them are<br>those that were reared on thy head, as also many hawks and many others of<br>other species. Behold, O Brahmana, those birds have contracted their<br>wings and legs for entering their respective nests. Summon them, O<br>regenerate one! There those birds, treated with affection by thee, are<br>displaying their love for thee that art their father. Without doubt, thou<br>art their father, O Jajali! Do thou summon thy children.'<br><br>"Bhishma continued, 'Then those birds, summoned by Jajali, made answer<br>agreeably to the dictates of that religion which is not fraught with<br>injury to any creature.<span class="footnote-tooltip" style="color:rgb(255,193,7);"><sup><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i></sup><span class="footnote-tooltip-text">The soul is itself a tirtha. A tirtha, of course, is a spot containing sacred water. One should seek the acquisition of merit in the soul instead of going to places called sacred and lying in different parts of the earth. 'According to his own ability' means 'according to the best of his power.' If one can perform a sacrifice with clarified butter, one should not do it with the dust of a cow's hoofs.  </span></span> All acts that are done without injuring any<br>creature become serviceable (to the doer) both here and hereafter. Those<br>acts, however, that involve injury to others, destroy faith, and faith<br>being destroyed, involves the destroyer in ruin. The sacrifices of those<br>that regard acquisition and non-acquisition in the same light, that are<br>endued with faith that are self-restrained, that have tranquil minds, and<br>that perform sacrifices from a sense of duty (and not from desire of<br>fruit), become productive of fruit.<span class="footnote-tooltip" style="color:rgb(255,193,7);"><sup><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i></sup><span class="footnote-tooltip-text">Dharmasya vachanat kila is explained by the commentator as Dharmasya ahinsatmakasya samvandhino vachanat. I think the words may also mean, 'obeying the voice of Dharma.'  </span></span> Faith with respect to Brahma is<br>the daughter of Surya, O regenerate one. She is the protectress and she<br>is the giver of good birth. Faith is superior to the merit born of<br>(Vedic) recitations and meditation.<span class="footnote-tooltip" style="color:rgb(255,193,7);"><sup><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i></sup><span class="footnote-tooltip-text">The two negatives in the second line amount to an affirmative assertion.  </span></span> An act vitiated by defect of<br>speech is saved by Faith. An act vitiated by defect of mind is saved by<br>Faith. But neither speech nor mind can save an act that is vitiated by<br>want of Faith.<span class="footnote-tooltip" style="color:rgb(255,193,7);"><sup><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i></sup><span class="footnote-tooltip-text">Vaivaswati is 'appertaining to Vivaswat or prakasarapachidatma', hence 'Brahma-vishayini. 'Daughter of Surya' means Sattwiki. Faith is vahirvangamanasi, i.e., is 'the outward form of speech and mind,' implying that it 'transcends (the merit born of) speech (recitation) and mind (meditation).'  </span></span> Men conversant with the occurrences of the past<br>recite in this connection the following verse sung by Brahman. The<br>offerings in sacrifices of a person that is pure (in body and acts) but<br>wanting in Faith, and of another that is impure (in respect of their<br>worthiness of acceptance). The food, again, of a person conversant with<br>the Vedas but miserly in behaviour, and that of a usurer that is liberal<br>in conduct,<span class="footnote-tooltip" style="color:rgb(255,193,7);"><sup><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i></sup><span class="footnote-tooltip-text">'Defects of speech' are the incorrect utterance of mantras. 'Defects of mind' are such as listlessness, haste, etc.  </span></span> the deities after careful consideration, had held to be<br>equal (in respect of their worthiness of acceptance). The' Supreme Lord<br>of all creatures (viz., Brahman) then told them that they had committed<br>an error. The food of a liberal person is sanctified by Faith. The food,<br>however, of the person that is void of Faith is lost in consequence of<br>such want of Faith. The food of a liberal usurer is acceptable but not<br>the food of a miser.<span class="footnote-tooltip" style="color:rgb(255,193,7);"><sup><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i></sup><span class="footnote-tooltip-text">Kadarya is explained by the commentator as 'miserly.' I think it may be taken also in a more extended sense. Then again vardhushi is a usurer and not necessarily a dealer in corn.  </span></span> Only one person in the world, viz., he that is<br>bereft of Faith, is unfit to make offerings to the deities. The food of<br>only such a man is unfit to be eaten. This is the opinion of men<br>conversant with duties. Want of Faith is a high sin. Faith is a cleanser<br>of sins. Like a snake casting off its slough, the man of Faith succeeds<br>in casting off all his sin. The religion of abstention with Faith is<br>superior to all things considered sacred. Abstaining from all faults of<br>behaviour, he who betakes himself to Faith, becomes sanctified. What need<br>hath such a person of penances, or of conduct, or of endurance? Every man<br>has Faith. Faith, however, is of three kinds, viz., as affected by<br>Sattwa, by Rajas and by Tamas, and according to the kind of Faith that<br>one has, one is named. Persons endued with goodness and possessed of<br>insight into the true import of morality have thus laid down the subject<br>of duties. We have, as the result of our enquiries, got all this from the<br>sage Dharmadarsana. O thou of great wisdom, betake thyself to Faith, for<br>thou shalt then obtain that which is superior. He who has Faith (in the<br>declarations of the Srutis), and who acts according to their import (in<br>the belief that they are good for him), is certainly of righteous soul. O<br>Jajali, he who adheres to his own path (under the influence of Faith) is<br>certainly a superior person.'<br><br>"Bhishma continued, 'After a short while, Tuladhara and Jajali, both of<br>whom had been endued with great wisdom, ascended to heaven and sported<br>there in great happiness,<span class="footnote-tooltip" style="color:rgb(255,193,7);"><sup><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i></sup><span class="footnote-tooltip-text">The commentator is entirely silent upon this verse. The two Bengali versions have proceeded in two different ways. The four classes of persons indicated in the previous verses are (1) he that is destitute of faith but is (outwardly) pure, (2) he that has faith but is not (outwardly) pure, (3) a miserly person possessed of learning, and (4) a usurer endued with liberality. The answer of Brahman, without touching other points, refers particularly to faith. The liberal man's food is sanctified by faith. The food of him that has no faith is lost. For this reason, the liberal man's food, even if he happens to be a usurer, is worthy of acceptance, and not so the food of the miser even though he may be possessed of Vedic lore.  </span></span> having reached their respective places<br>earned by their respective acts. Many truths of this kind were spoken of<br>by Tuladhara. That eminent person understood this religion (of abstention<br>from injury) completely. These eternal duties were accordingly proclaimed<br>by him. The regenerate Jajali, O son of Kunti, having heard these words<br>of celebrated energy, betook himself to tranquillity. In this way, many<br>truths of grave import were uttered by Tuladhara, illustrated by examples<br>for instruction. What other truths dost thou wish to hear?'"
