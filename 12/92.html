                    "Yudhishthira said, 'How should a righteous king, who is desirous of<br>adhering to a course of righteousness, behave? I ask thee this, O<br>foremost of men! Answer me, O Grandsire!'<br><br>"Bhishma said, 'In this connection is cited the old story of what<br>Vamadeva gifted with great intelligence and acquainted with the true<br>import of everything sang in ancient time. Once upon a time, king<br>Vasumanas, possessed of knowledge and fortitude and purity of behaviour,<br>asked the great Rishi Vamadeva of high ascetic merit, saying, 'Instruct<br>me, O holy one, in words fraught with righteousness and of grave impart,<br>as to the conduct to be observed by me so that I may not fall away from<br>the duties prescribed for me.' Unto him of a golden complexion and seated<br>at his ease like Yayati, son of Nahusha, that foremost of ascetics, viz.,<br>Vamadeva, of great energy, said as follows:<br><br>"Vamadeva said, 'Do thou act righteously. There is nothing superior to<br>righteousness. Those kings that are observant of righteousness, succeed<br>in conquering the whole earth. That king who regards righteousness to be<br>the most efficacious means for accomplishing his objects, and who acts<br>according to the counsels of those that are righteous, blazes forth with<br>righteousness. That king who disregards righteousness and desires to act<br>with brute force, soon falls away from righteousness and loses both<br>Righteousness and Profit. That king who acts according to the counsels of<br>a vicious and sinful minister becomes a destroyer of righteousness and<br>deserves to be slain by his subjects with all his family. Indeed, he very<br>soon meets with destruction. That king who is incompetent to discharge<br>the duties of state-craft, who is governed by caprice in all his acts,<br>and who indulges in brag, soon meets with destruction even if he happens<br>to be ruler of the whole earth. That king, on the other hand, who is<br>desirous of prosperity, who is free from malice, who has his senses under<br>control, and who is gifted with intelligence, thrives in affluence like<br>the ocean swelling with the waters discharged into it by a hundred<br>streams. He should never consider himself to have a sufficiency of<br>virtue, enjoyments, wealth, intelligence, and friends. Upon these depends<br>the conduct of the world. By listening to these counsels, a king obtains<br>fame', achievements, prosperity, and subjects. Devoted to virtue, that<br>king who seeks the acquisition of virtue and wealth by such means, and<br>who begins all his measures after reflecting upon their objects, succeeds<br>in obtaining great prosperity. That king who is illiberal, and without<br>affection, who afflicts his subjects by undue chastisements, and who is<br>rash in his acts, soon meets with destruction. That king who is not<br>gifted with intelligence fails to see his own faults. Covered with infamy<br>here, he sinks into hell hereafter. If the king gives proper honour to<br>them that deserve it, makes gifts, and recognises the value of sweet<br>speeches by himself uttering them on all occasions, his subjects then<br>dispel the calamities that overtake him, as if these had fallen upon<br>themselves. That king who has no instructor in the ways of righteousness<br>and who never asks others for counsels, and who seeks to acquire wealth<br>by means that caprice suggests, never succeeds in enjoying happiness<br>long. That king, on the other hand, who listens to the instructions of<br>his preceptors in matters connected with virtue, who supervises the<br>affairs of his kingdom himself, and who in all his acquisitions is guided<br>by considerations of virtue, succeed in enjoying happiness for a long<br>time.'"<span class="footnote-tooltip" style="color:rgb(255,193,7);"><sup><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i></sup><span class="footnote-tooltip-text">K.P. Singh, I think, translates this verse erroneously. The Burdwan version is correct. The speaker, in this verse, desires to illustrate the force of righteous conduct. Transcribers' note: There was no corresponding footnote reference in the text, so I have assigned this footnote to an arbitrary location on the page--JBH.  </span></span>
