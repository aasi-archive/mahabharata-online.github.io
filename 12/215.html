                            "Bhishma said, 'Living creatures, by being attached to objects of the<br>senses which are always fraught with evil, become helpless. Those<br>high-souled persons, however, who are not attached to them, attain to the<br>highest end. The man of intelligence, beholding the world over-whelmed<br>with the evils constituted by birth, death, decrepitude, sorrow, disease,<br>and anxieties, should exert themselves for the attainment of<br>Emancipation. He should be pure in speech, thought, and body; he should<br>be free from pride. Of tranquil soul and possessed of knowledge, he<br>should lead a life of mendicancy, and pursue happiness without being<br>attached to any worldly object. Again, if attachment be seen to possess<br>the mind in consequence of compassion to creatures, he should, seeing<br>that the universe is the result of acts, show indifference in respect of<br>compassion itself.<span class="footnote-tooltip" style="color:rgb(255,193,7);"><sup><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i></sup><span class="footnote-tooltip-text">Adatte from da meaning to cut or destroy. Manasam volam as explained by the commentator, is sankalpam, i.e., desires or purposes. The man of ripe understanding, by doing this, attains to that knowledge which is not subject to decay with age. Hence, such knowledge is superior to knowledge acquired in the ordinary way.  </span></span> Whatever good, acts are performed, or whatever<br>sin (is perpetrated), the doer tastes the consequences. Hence, one<br>should, in speech, thought, and deed, do only acts that are good.<span class="footnote-tooltip" style="color:rgb(255,193,7);"><sup><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i></sup><span class="footnote-tooltip-text">Compassion may sometimes lead to excess of attachment, as in the case of Bharata towards his little deer. The universe is the result of acts because acts determine the character of the life the soul assumes. In the case of Bharata, he was obliged to take birth as a deer in his next life in consequence of all his thoughts in the previous life having been centred on a deer.  </span></span> He<br>succeeds in obtaining happiness who practises abstention from injuring<br>(others), truthfulness of speech, honesty towards all creatures, and<br>forgiveness, and who is never heedless. Hence one, exercising one's<br>intelligence, should dispose one's mind, after training it, on peace<br>towards all creatures.<span class="footnote-tooltip" style="color:rgb(255,193,7);"><sup><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i></sup><span class="footnote-tooltip-text">K.P. Singha wrongly translates this verse. Tat should be supplied before asnute; there is redundant va in the first line. The Burdwan translator renders it correctly.  </span></span> That man who regards the practice of the<br>virtues enumerated above as the highest duty, as conducive to the<br>happiness of all creatures, and as destructive of all kinds of sorrow, is<br>possessed of the highest knowledge, and succeeds in obtaining happiness.<br>Hence (as already said), one should, exercising one's intelligence,<br>dispose one's mind, after training it, on peace towards all creatures.<br>One should never think of doing evil to others. One should not covet what<br>is far above one's power to attain. One should not turn one's thoughts<br>towards objects that are non-existent. One should, on the other hand,<br>direct one's mind towards knowledge by such persistent efforts as are<br>sure to succeed.<span class="footnote-tooltip" style="color:rgb(255,193,7);"><sup><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i></sup><span class="footnote-tooltip-text">The buddhi here referred to is intelligence cleansed by scriptures. Samahitam manak is, as explained by the commentator, mind freed from anger and malice, etc., i.e., properly trained.  </span></span> With the aid of the declarations of the Srutis and<br>of persistent efforts calculated to bring success, that Knowledge is sure<br>to flow. One that is desirous of saying good words or observing a<br>religion that is refined of all dross, should utter only truth that is<br>not fraught with any malice or censure. One that is possessed of a sound<br>heart should utter words that are not fraught with dishonesty, that are<br>not harsh, that are not cruel, that are not evil, and that are not<br>characterised by garrulity. The universe is bound in speech. If disposed<br>to renunciation (of all worldly objects) then should one proclaim,<span class="footnote-tooltip" style="color:rgb(255,193,7);"><sup><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i></sup><span class="footnote-tooltip-text">One should not covet, etc., like kingdoms and thrones in the case of ordinary men. "Non-existent objects," such as sons and wives that are dead or that are unborn or unwed.  </span></span><br>which a mind fraught with humility and a cleansed understanding, one's<br>own evil acts.<span class="footnote-tooltip" style="color:rgb(255,193,7);"><sup><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i></sup><span class="footnote-tooltip-text">Samsara, as explained by the commentator, means both this and the other world. It is bound in speech in this sense, viz., that whatever is spoken is never destroyed and affects permanently both the speaker and the listener, so that not only in one life, but in the infinite course of lives, the speaker will be affected for good or for evil by the words that escape his lips. This fully accords with the discovery of modern science, so eloquently and poetically enunciated by Babbage, of the indestructibility of force or energy when once applied. How appalling is the sanction (which is not a myth) under which evil speaking is forbidden.  </span></span> He who betakes himself to action, impelled thereto by<br>propensities fraught with the attribute of Passion, obtains much misery<br>in this world and at last sinks into hell. One should, therefore,<br>practise self-restraint in body, speech, and mind. Ignorant persons<br>bearing the burdens of the world are like robbers laden with their booty<br>of straggling sheep (secreted from herds taken out for pasture). The<br>latter are always regardful of roads that are unfavourable to them (owing<br>to the presence of the king's watch).<span class="footnote-tooltip" style="color:rgb(255,193,7);"><sup><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i></sup><span class="footnote-tooltip-text">Such self-disclosure destroys the effects of those acts and prevents their recurrence.  </span></span> Indeed, as robbers have to<br>throw away their spoil if they wish for safety, even so should a person<br>cast off all acts dictated by Passion and Darkness if he is to obtain<br>felicity. Without doubt, a person that is without desire, free from the<br>bonds of the world, contented to live in solitude, abstemious in diet,<br>devoted to penances and with senses under control, that has burnt all his<br>sorrows by (the acquisition of) knowledge, that takes a pleasure in<br>practising all the particulars of yoga discipline, and that has a<br>cleansed soul, succeeds, in consequence of his mind being withdrawn into<br>itself, in attaining to Brahma or Emancipation.<span class="footnote-tooltip" style="color:rgb(255,193,7);"><sup><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i></sup><span class="footnote-tooltip-text">Robbers laden with booty are always in danger of seizure. Even so unintelligent men bearing the burdens of life are always liable to destruction.  </span></span> One endued with<br>patience and a cleansed soul, should, without doubt, control one's<br>understanding. With the understanding (thus disciplined), one should next<br>control one's mind, and then with the mind overpower the objects of the<br>senses. Upon the mind being thus brought under control and the senses<br>being all subdued, the senses will become luminous and gladly enter into<br>Brahma. When one's senses are withdrawn into the mind, the result that<br>occurs is that Brahma becomes manifested in it. Indeed, when the senses<br>are destroyed., and the soul returns to the attribute of pure existence,<br>it comes to be regarded as transformed into Brahma. Then again, one<br>should never make a display of one's yoga power. On the other hand, one<br>should always exert to restrain one's senses by practising the rules of<br>yoga. Indeed, one engaged in the practice of yoga rules should do all<br>those acts by which one's conduct and disposition may become pure.<span class="footnote-tooltip" style="color:rgb(255,193,7);"><sup><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i></sup><span class="footnote-tooltip-text">Nishpraiharena means Niruddhena as explained by the commentator.  </span></span><br>(Without making one's yoga powers the means of one's subsistence) one<br>should rather live upon broken grains of corn, ripe beans, dry cakes of<br>seeds from which the oil has been pressed out, pot-herbs, half-ripe<br>barley, flour of fried pulses, fruits, and roots, obtained in alms.<span class="footnote-tooltip" style="color:rgb(255,193,7);"><sup><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i></sup><span class="footnote-tooltip-text">I adopt the reading prakasela and the interpretation that Nilakantha puts upon it.  </span></span><br>Reflecting upon the characteristics of time and place, one should<br>according to one's inclinations observe, after proper examination, vows<br>and rules about fasts. One should not suspend an observance that has been<br>begun. Like one slowly creating a fire, one should gradually extend an<br>act that is prompted by knowledge. By doing so, Brahma gradually shines<br>in one like the Sun. The Ignorance which has Knowledge for its resting<br>ground, extends its influence over all the three states (of waking,<br>dreaming and dreamless slumber). The Knowledge, again, that follows the<br>Understanding, is assailed by Ignorance.<span class="footnote-tooltip" style="color:rgb(255,193,7);"><sup><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i></sup><span class="footnote-tooltip-text">K.P. Singha translates these words very carelessly. The Burdwan translator, by following the commentator closely, has produced a correct version. Kulmasha means ripe grains or seeds of the Phaselous radiatus. Pinyaka is the cake of mustard seed or sesamum after the oil has been pressed out. Yavaka means unripe barley, or, as the commentator explains, raw barley powdered and boiled in hot water.  </span></span> The evil-hearted person<br>fails to obtain a knowledge of the Soul in consequence of taking it as<br>united with the three states although in reality it transcends them all.<br>When, however, he succeeds in apprehending the limits under which the<br>two, viz., union with the three states and separation from them, are<br>manifested, it is then that he becomes divested of attachment and attains<br>to Emancipation. When such an apprehension has been attained, one<br>transcends the effects of age, rises superior to the consequences of<br>decrepitude and death, and obtains Brahma which is eternal, deathless,<br>immutable, undeteriorating.'"
