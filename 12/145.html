                            "Bhishma said, 'Hearing those piteous lamentations of the pigeon on the<br>tree, the she-pigeon seized by the fowler began to say to herself as<br>follows.'<br><br>"The she-pigeon said, 'Whether I have any merit or not, verily there is<br>no limit to any good fortune when my dear lord thus speaks of me. She is<br>no wife with whom her lord is not content. In the case of women, if their<br>lords be gratified with them all the deities also become so. Since the<br>marriage union takes place in the presence of fire, the husband is the<br>wife's highest deity. That wife with whom her husband is not pleased<br>becomes consumed into ashes, even like a creeper adorned with bunches of<br>flowers in a forest conflagration.' Having reflected thus, the<br>she-pigeon, afflicted with woe, and immured by the fowler within his<br>cage, thus spoke unto her woe-stricken lord, 'I shall say what is now<br>beneficial for thee.' Hearing me follow thou my counsel, O dear lord, be<br>thou the rescuer of a suppliant. This fowler lies here by thy abode,<br>afflicted with cold and hunger. Do him the duties of hospitality. The sin<br>that a person commits by slaying a Brahmana or that mother of the world,<br>viz., a cow, is equal to that which one incurs by suffering a suppliant<br>to perish (from want of help). Thou art possessed of knowledge of self.<br>It ever behoves one like thee, therefore, to follow that course which has<br>been ordained for us as pigeons by the order of our birth.<span class="footnote-tooltip" style="color:rgb(255,193,7);"><sup><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i></sup><span class="footnote-tooltip-text">The idea that man comes alone into the world and goes out of it alone. Only the wife is his true associate for she alone is a sharer of his merits, and without her no merit can be won. The Hindu idea of marriage is a complete union. From the day of marriage the two persons become one individual for the performance of all religious and other acts.  </span></span> It has<br>been heard by us that the householder who practises virtue according to<br>the measure of his abilities, wins hereafter inexhaustible regions of<br>bliss. Thou hast sons. Thou hast progeny. O bird, casting off all<br>kindness for thy own body, therefore, and for winning virtue and profit,<br>offer worship to this fowler so that his heart may be pleased. Do not, O<br>bird, indulge in any grief on my account. (See, how unimportant I am!)<br>Thou mayst continue to live, taking other wives!' The amiable she-pigeon,<br>overcome with sorrow, and casting her eyes upon her lord from the<br>fowler's cage within which she had been immured, said these words unto<br>him.'"
