                    "Yudhishthira said, 'After doing what acts does a man become liable to<br>perform expiation? And what are those acts which he must do for being<br>freed from sin? Tell me this, O grandsire.'<br><br>"Vyasa said, 'Having omitted to do those acts that have been ordained,<br>and done those that have been interdicted, and having behaved<br>deceitfully, a man becomes liable to perform expiation. The person in the<br>observance of the Brahmacharya vow, who rises from bed after the sun has<br>risen or goes to bed while the sun is setting, one who has a rotten nail<br>or black teeth, one whose younger brother weds first, one who weds before<br>his elder brother is wedded, one who has been guilty of the slaughter of<br>a Brahmana, one who speaks ill of others, one who weds a younger sister<br>before the elder sister has been wedded, one who weds an elder sister<br>after having wedded a younger one, one who falls away from a vow, one who<br>slays any one of the regenerate classes, one who imparts a knowledge of<br>the Vedas to a person unworthy of it, one who does not impart a knowledge<br>thereof to a person that is worthy of it, one who takes many lives, one<br>who sells flesh, one who has abandoned his (sacred) fire, one who sells a<br>knowledge of the Vedas,<span class="footnote-tooltip" style="color:rgb(255,193,7);"><sup><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i></sup><span class="footnote-tooltip-text">i.e., charges his pupils a fee for teaching them the scriptures.  </span></span> one who slays his preceptor or a woman, one<br>born in a sinful family, one who slays an animal wilfully,<span class="footnote-tooltip" style="color:rgb(255,193,7);"><sup><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i></sup><span class="footnote-tooltip-text">i.e., not in a sacrifice.  </span></span> one who<br>sets fire to a dwelling house, one who lives by deceit, one who acts in<br>opposition to his preceptor, and one who has violated a compact,&#8212;these<br>all are guilty of sins requiring expiation. I shall now mention other<br>acts that men should not do, viz., acts that are interdicted by both the<br>world and the Vedas. Listen to me with concentrated attention. The<br>rejection of one's own creed, the practice of other people's creed,<br>assisting at the sacrifice or the religious rites of one that is not<br>worthy of such assistance, eating of food that is forbidden, deserting<br>one that craves protection, neglect in maintaining servants and<br>dependants, selling salt and treacle (and similar other substances),<br>killing of birds and animals, refusal, though competent, to procreate<br>upon a soliciting woman, omission to present the daily gifts (of handfuls<br>of grass to kine and the like), omission to present the dakshina,<br>humiliating a Brahmana,&#8212;these all have been pronounced by persons<br>conversant with duty to be acts that no one should do. The son that<br>quarrels with the father, the person that violates the bed of his<br>preceptor, one that neglects to produce offspring in one's wedded wife,<br>are all sinful, O tiger among men! I have now declared to thee, in brief<br>as also in detail, those acts and omissions by which a man becomes liable<br>to perform expiation.
