                    "Bhishma said, 'Do thou, O son, O sinless one, listen once more, with<br>feelings of great pride, to the words that fell from the lips of the<br>Island-born Rishi on the subject of the enumeration of the entities. Like<br>unto a blazing fire (for having transcended all ignorance), the great<br>Rishi said these words unto his son who resembled a fire wrapped in<br>smoke.<span class="footnote-tooltip" style="color:rgb(255,193,7);"><sup><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i></sup><span class="footnote-tooltip-text">The sense is that the understanding, being stained or afflicted, the Soul also becomes stained or afflicted. Enam is atmanam. Vidhritam is 'placed like an image upon a mirror.'  </span></span> Instructed by what he said, I also, O son, shall again<br>expound to thee that certain knowledge (which dispels ignorance). The<br>properties possessed by earth are immobility, weight, hardness,<br>productiveness, scent, density, capacity to absorb scents of all kinds,<br>cohesion, habitableness (in respect of vegetables and animals), and that<br>attribute of the mind which is called patience of the capacity to bear.<br>The properties of water are coolness, taste, moisture, liquidity,<br>softness, agreeableness, tongue, fluidity, capacity to be congealed, and<br>power to melt many earthly products.<span class="footnote-tooltip" style="color:rgb(255,193,7);"><sup><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i></sup><span class="footnote-tooltip-text">Because the son had not yet obtained the light of full knowledge.  </span></span> The properties of fire are<br>irresistible energy, inflammability, heat, capacity t o soften, light,<br>sorrow, disease, speed, fury, and invariably upward motion. The<br>properties of the wind are touch that is neither hot nor cool, capacity<br>to assist the organ of speech, independence (in respect of motion),<br>strength, celerity, power to assist all kinds of emission or discharge,<br>power to raise other objects, breaths inhaled and exhaled, life (as the<br>attribute of Chit) and birth (including death). The properties of space<br>are sound, extension, capacity of being enclosed, absence of refuge for<br>resting upon absence of all necessity for such refuge, status of being<br>unmanifest, capacity for modification, incapacity for producing<br>resistance, material cause for producing the sense of hearing, and the<br>unoccupied portions of the human body. These are the fifty properties, as<br>declared, that constitute, the essence of the five elementary<br>entities.<span class="footnote-tooltip" style="color:rgb(255,193,7);"><sup><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i></sup><span class="footnote-tooltip-text">It is curious to note how carelessly this verse is rendered in the Burdwan version. In the Bengal texts there is a misprint, viz., tatha for rasah. The Burdwan translator does not notice it, but gives just eight qualities instead of ten. Capacity to be congealed is to be inferred from cha. K.P. Singha is correct.  </span></span> Patience, reasoning or disputation, remembrance,<br>forgetfulness or error, imagination, endurance, propensity towards good,<br>propensity towards evil, and restlessness,&#8212;these are the properties of<br>the mind. Destruction of both good and evil thoughts (i.e., dreamless<br>slumber), perseverance, concentration, decision, and ascertainment of all<br>things resting upon direct evidence, constitute the five properties of<br>the understanding.'<br><br>"Yudhishthira said, 'How can the understanding be said to have five<br>properties? How again, can the five senses be spoken of as properties (of<br>the five elementary entities)? Expound to me, O grandsire, all this that<br>seems to be very abstruse.'<br><br>"Bhishma said, 'The understanding is said to possess altogether sixty<br>properties, for the understanding includes the five elements.<span class="footnote-tooltip" style="color:rgb(255,193,7);"><sup><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i></sup><span class="footnote-tooltip-text">The Rishis, it is evident, regarded an entity not as an unknown substance in which certain known properties inhered, but as the sum total of those properties themselves. So far as the human mind is concerned, there is no warrant for the proposition that matter is an unknown substance in which extension, and divisibility etc., inhere; on the other hand, matter, as it appears to us, is only extension, divisibility, etc., existing in a combined state.  </span></span> All<br>those properties exist in a state of union with the Soul. The Vedas<br>declare, O son, that the elements, their (fifty) properties (together<br>with the mind and the understanding and their nine and five properties)<br>are all created by Him who is above all deterioration. These (one and<br>seventy) entities, therefore, are not eternal (like the Soul). The<br>theories contradicting the Revelation that have in the previous Vedas, O<br>son, been placed before thee (about the origin of the Universe and its<br>other incidents) are all defective in the eye of reason. Carefully<br>attending, however, in this world to all that I have said unto thee about<br>the Supreme Brahma, do thou, after attaining to the puissance that the<br>knowledge of Brahma offers, seek to win tranquillity of heart.'"<span class="footnote-tooltip" style="color:rgb(255,193,7);"><sup><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i></sup><span class="footnote-tooltip-text">The elements are five in number. Their properties number fifty. The five especial properties of the understanding should be added to those five and fifty. The total, therefore, of the properties of the understanding comes up to sixty.  </span></span>
