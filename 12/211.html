                            "Bhishma said, 'All immobile and mobile beings, distributed into four<br>classes, have been said to be of unmanifest birth and unmanifest death.<br>Existing only in the unmanifest Soul, the Mind is said to possess the<br>attributes of the unmanifest.<span class="footnote-tooltip" style="color:blue;"><sup><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i></sup><span class="footnote-tooltip-text">What is meant seems to be this: there can be no river without water. A river cannot exist without water. When a river is mentioned, water is implied. The connection between a river and water is not an accident but a necessary one. The same may be said of the sun and its rays. After the same manner, the connection between the Soul and the body is a necessary one and not an accident. The Soul cannot exist without a body. Of course, the ordinary case only is referred to here, for, by yoga, one can dissociate the Soul from the body and incorporate it with Brahma.  </span></span> As a vast tree is ensconced within a<br>small unblown Aswattha flower and becomes observable only when it comes<br>out, even so birth takes place from what is unmanifest. A piece of iron,<br>which is inanimate, runs towards a piece of loadstone. Similarly,<br>inclinations and propensities due to natural instincts, and all else, run<br>towards the Soul in a new life.<span class="footnote-tooltip" style="color:blue;"><sup><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i></sup><span class="footnote-tooltip-text">The mind his no existence except as it exists in the Soul. The commentator uses the illustration of the second moon seen by the eye in water, etc., for explaining the nature of the Mind. It has no real existence as dissociated from the Soul.  </span></span> Indeed, even as those propensities<br>and possessions born of Ignorance and Delusion, and inanimate in respect<br>of their nature, are united with Soul when reborn, after the same manner,<br>those other propensities and aspirations of the Soul that have their gaze<br>directed towards Brahma become united with it, coming to it directly from<br>Brahma itself.<span class="footnote-tooltip" style="color:blue;"><sup><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i></sup><span class="footnote-tooltip-text">Swabhavahetuja bhavah is explained by the commentator as the virtuous and vicious propensities. (Swabhava purvasamskara; sa eva heturyesham karmanam layah bhavah). 'All else,' of course, means Avidya or Maya, which flows directly from Brahma without being dependent on past acts. The meaning, then, is this: as soon as the Soul takes a new form or body, all the propensities and inclinations, as dependent on its past acts, take possession of it, Avidya or Maya also takes possession of it.  </span></span> Neither earth, nor sky, nor heaven, nor things, nor<br>the vital breaths, nor virtue and vice, nor anything else, existed<br>before, save the Chit-Soul. Nor have they any necessary connection with<br>even the Chit-Soul defiled by Ignorance.<span class="footnote-tooltip" style="color:blue;"><sup><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i></sup><span class="footnote-tooltip-text">Both the vernacular translators have wrongly rendered this verse, notwithstanding the help they have derived from Nilakantha's gloss. The fact is, the gloss itself sometimes requires a gloss. Verses 3 and 4 and connected with each other. In verse, 3, the speaker mentions two analogies viz., first, that of iron, which is inanimate, following the loadstone, and, second, of Swabhavahetuja bhavah (meaning, as already explained, all such consequences as are born of the acts of previous lives), as also anyadapi, i.e., all else of a similar nature, meaning, of course, the consequences of 'Avidya' or 'Maya' which flow directly from Brahma instead of former acts. In verse 4, reference is again made to avyaktajabhavah, meaning propensities and possessions born of 'Avidya' or 'Maya'. This is only a repetition, in another form, of what has already been stated in the second line of verse 3. The commentator explains this very clearly in the opening words of his gloss. After this comes the reference to the higher propensities and aspirations that are in the Soul. The grammar of the line is this: Tadvat Kartuh karanalakshanah (bhavah) karanat abhisanghathah. The plain meaning, of course, is that like all the darker and indifferent propensities and possessions that come to the Soul in its new life, born of the acts of past lives, all the higher aspirations also of the Soul come to it from Brahma direct. The word karana is used in both instances for Brahma as the Supreme Cause of everything.  </span></span> The Soul is eternal. It is<br>indestructible. It occurs in every creature. It is the cause of the Mind.<br>It is without attributes, This universe that we perceive hath been<br>declared (in the Vedas) to be due to Ignorance or Delusion. The Soul's<br>apprehensions of form, etc., are due to past desires.<span class="footnote-tooltip" style="color:blue;"><sup><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i></sup><span class="footnote-tooltip-text">The sense is this: In the beginning there was nothing save the Chit-Soul. Existent objects exist only because of Ignorance having defiled the Soul. Their connection again with the Soul is not absolute and necessary, That connection may be destroyed without the Soul losing anything. What is intended to be conveyed by this verse is that at first, i.e., before the creation, there was nothing, except jiva or the Soul with Knowledge alone for its indicating attribute. The things mentioned, viz., earth, etc., were not. Nor do they inhere to jiva with even Ignorance or Delusion for its indicating attribute, i.e., to the born, Soul. The born Soul may seem to manifest all those attributes, but it is really independent of or separate from them. Their connection with the Soul, as already said, is neither absolute nor eternal. In the next verse, the speaker explains the nature of those manifestations.  </span></span> The Soul, when<br>it becomes endued with those causes (viz., desire), is led to the state<br>of its being engaged in acts. In consequence of that condition (for those<br>acts again produce desires to end in acts anew and so on),&#8212;this vast<br>wheel to existence revolves, without beginning and without end.<span class="footnote-tooltip" style="color:blue;"><sup><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i></sup><span class="footnote-tooltip-text">The connection between earth, etc., with the Soul has before been said to be neither absolute nor eternal. Whence then that connection? In 6, it is said that all the apprehensions of the Soul with regard to earth, etc., are due to Ignorance or Delusion flowing directly from Brahma and assailing it thereafter. The apprehension of the Soul that it is a man or an animal, that it has a body, that it is acting, etc., are to borrow the commentator's illustration, just like that of one's being a king in a dream who is not, however, really a king, or of one's being a child who is not, however, really a child. Being eternal or without beginning its first existence under the influence of Delusion is untraceable. As long, again, as it has Knowledge alone for its attribute, it remains indestructible, i.e., free from the mutations of existence. It occurs in every creature, i.e., in man and beast.  </span></span> The<br>Unmanifest, viz., the Understanding (with the desires), is the nave of<br>that wheel. The Manifest (i.e., the body with the senses) constitutes its<br>assemblage of spokes, the perceptions and acts from its circumference.<br>Propelled by the quality of Rajas (Passion), the Soul presides over it<br>(witnessing its revolutions). Like oilmen pressing oilseeds in their<br>machine, the consequences born of Ignorance, assailing the universe (of<br>creatures) which is moistened by Rajas, press or grind it in that wheel.<br>In that succession of existences, the living creature, seized by the idea<br>of Self in consequence of desire, engages itself in acts. In the union of<br>cause and effect, those acts again become (new causes).<span class="footnote-tooltip" style="color:blue;"><sup><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i></sup><span class="footnote-tooltip-text">The sense seems to be this: In consequence of desires the Soul manifests itself in some form of existence. In that state it acts. Those acts again lead to desires anew, which, in their turn, bring on new forms or states of existence. The circle of existence or life thus goes on, without beginning and without end.  </span></span> Effects do<br>not enter into causes. Nor do causes enter into effects. In the<br>production of effects, Time is the Cause. The primordial essences (eight<br>in number as mentioned before), and their modifications six-(teen in<br>number), fraught with causes, exists in a state of union, in consequence<br>of their being always presided over by the Soul. Like dust following the<br>wind that moves it, the creature-Soul, divested of body, but endued still<br>with inclinations born of Passion and Darkness and with principles of<br>causes constituted by the acts of the life that is over, moves on,<br>following the direction that the Supreme Soul gives it. The Soul,<br>however, is never touched by those inclinations and propensities. Nor are<br>these touched by the Soul that is superior to them. The wind, which is<br>naturally pure, is never stained by the dust it bears away.<span class="footnote-tooltip" style="color:blue;"><sup><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i></sup><span class="footnote-tooltip-text">The Cause is ignorance. The Effect is the body and the senses of a particular form of existence. When the creature, in consequence of this union, engages in acts, these latter become causes for new states of existence.  </span></span> As the<br>wind is truly separate from the dust it bears away, even so, the man of<br>wisdom should know, is the connection between that which is called<br>existence or life and the Soul. No one should take it that the Soul, in<br>consequence of its apparent union with the body and the senses and the<br>other propensities and beliefs and unbeliefs, is really endued therewith<br>as its necessary and absolute qualities. On the other hand, the Soul<br>should be taken as existing in its own nature. Thus did the divine Rishi<br>solve the doubt that had taken possession of his disciple's mind.<br>Notwithstanding all this, people depend upon means consisting of acts and<br>scriptural rites for casting off misery and winning happiness. Seeds that<br>are scorched by fire do not put forth sprouts. After the same manner, if<br>everything that contributes to misery be consumed by the fire of true<br>knowledge, the Soul escapes the obligation of rebirth in the world.'
