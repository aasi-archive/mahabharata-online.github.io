Arrived there, he enquired of him, in proper words, about the<br>Naga of whom he had heard from his guest, and instructed by him he<br>pursued his journey. With a clear idea of the purpose of his journey, the<br>Brahmana then reached the house of the Naga. Entering it duly, he<br>proclaimed himself in proper words, saying,&#8212;Ho! who is there!' I am a<br>Brahmana, come hither as a guest!&#8212;Hearing these words, the chaste wife<br>of the Naga, possessed of great beauty and devoted to the observance of<br>all duties, showed herself. Always attentive to the duties of<br>hospitality, she worshipped the guest with due rites, and welcoming him,<br>said, 'What can I do for you?'<br><br>"The Brahmana said, 'O lady, I am sufficiently honoured by thee with the<br>sweet words thou hast said unto me. The fatigue of my journey has also<br>been dispelled. I desire, O blessed lady, to see thy excellent lord. This<br>is my high object. This is the one object of my desire. It is for this<br>reason that I have come today to the residence of the Naga, thy husband.'<br><br>"The wife of the Naga said, 'Reverend sir, my husband has gone to drag<br>the car of Surya for a month. O learned Brahmana, he will be back in<br>fifteen days, and will, without doubt show himself unto thee. I have thus<br>told thee the reason of my husband's absence from home. Be that as it<br>may, what else is there that I can do for thee? Tell me this!'<br><br>"The Brahmana said, 'O chaste lady, I have come hither with the object of<br>seeing thy husband. O reverend dame, I shall dwell in the adjacent<br>forest, waiting for his return. When thy husband comes back, do kindly<br>tell him that I have arrived at this place impelled by the desire of<br>seeing him. Thou shouldst also inform me of his return when that event<br>occurs. O blessed lady, I shall, till then, reside on the banks of the<br>Gomati, waiting for his return and living all the while upon frugal fare.<br>Having said this repeatedly unto the wife of the Naga, that foremost of<br>Brahmanas proceeded to the banks of the Gomati for residing there till<br>the time of the Naga's return.'"
