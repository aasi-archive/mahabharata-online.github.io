                    "Yudhishthira said, 'Living creatures always stand in fear of sorrow and<br>death. Tell me, O grandsire, how the occurrence of these two may be<br>prevented.'<br><br>"Bhishma said, 'In this connection, O Bharata, is cited the old narrative<br>of the discourse between Narada and Samanga.'<br><br>"Narada said, '(While others salute their superiors by only a bend of the<br>head) thou salutest thy superiors by prostrating thyself on the ground<br>till thy chest comes into contact with the ground. Thou seemest to be<br>engaged in crossing (the river of life) with thy hands.<span class="footnote-tooltip" style="color:rgb(255,193,7);"><sup><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i></sup><span class="footnote-tooltip-text">In the second line the word is Gadhamavidwansah, i.e., 'ignorant of its bottom or depth.' K.P. Singha gives the meaning correctly, without translating the verse literally, The Burdwan translator makes nonsense of it. Both however, wrongly take agadha as the final word in yathagadha, forgetting that agadham is a masculine adjective incapable of qualifying nadim which is feminine. Ayam is Jiva. The last clause is to be taken as buddhiyogam anuprachyuta ayam tatha.  </span></span> Thou<br>seemest to be always free from sorrow and exceedingly cheerful. I do not<br>see that thou hast the least anxiety. Thou art always content and happy<br>and thou seemest to sport (in felicity) like a child.'<br><br>"Samanga said, 'O giver of honours, I know the truth about the Past, the<br>Present, and the Future. Hence I never become cheerless.<span class="footnote-tooltip" style="color:rgb(255,193,7);"><sup><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i></sup><span class="footnote-tooltip-text">This is not a difficult verse, yet both the vernacular translators have misunderstood it. What is said in the first line is this: yat vahudosham karoti, yat (cha) purakritam, ekatah cha dushyati. Both the finite verbs have jnanin (the man of knowledge) for their nominative understood. Dushyati means nasyati or destroys. The meaning then is that the man of Knowledge destroys his sinful acts of both this and past lives. The commentator cites the well-known simile of the lotus leaf not being drenched or soaked with water even when dipped in water. Now, this is that unseen fruit of Knowledge. In the second line, the visible fruits are indicated. The man of Knowledge refrains from censuring the wicked acts of others and from perpetrating any wicked act himself. Yat cha dushyati means yat parakritam anishtam dushyati or nindati, yat karoti means yat swayam ragadi-doshat karoti; tadubhayam apriyam (sa) na karoti, the reason being dwaitadarsana-bhavah. Such a man truly regards the universe as identifiable with himself.  </span></span> I know<br>also what the beginning of acts is in this world, what the accession of<br>their fruits, and how varied are those fruits. Hence I never yield to<br>sorrow.<span class="footnote-tooltip" style="color:rgb(255,193,7);"><sup><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i></sup><span class="footnote-tooltip-text">i.e., in even thy direst distress thou dependest on thyself. To cross the fearful river of life without a raft and with the aid of only one's bare arms implies great self-dependence.  </span></span> Behold, the illiterate, the destitute, the prosperous, O<br>Narada, the blind, idiots and madmen, and ourselves also, all live.<span class="footnote-tooltip" style="color:rgb(255,193,7);"><sup><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i></sup><span class="footnote-tooltip-text">That which did not exist and will not exist, exists not at the present moment. Everything, therefore, which is of the nature of asat is non-existent. Our sorrows are connected with the asat. Knowing this, I have cast off all sorrows.  </span></span><br>These live by virtue of their acts of past lives. The very deities, who<br>exist freed from diseases, exist (in that state) by virtue of their past<br>acts. The strong and the weak, all, live by virtue of past acts. It is<br>fitting, therefore, that thou shouldst hold us in esteem. The owners of<br>thousands live. The owners of hundreds also live. They that are<br>overwhelmed with sorrow live. Behold, we too are living! When we, O<br>Narada, do not give way to grief, what can the practice of the duties (of<br>religion) or the observance of (religious) acts do to us? And since all<br>joys and sorrows also are not unending, they are, therefore, unable to<br>agitate us at all.<span class="footnote-tooltip" style="color:rgb(255,193,7);"><sup><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i></sup><span class="footnote-tooltip-text">I have understood that acts are for sorrow; that the fruits also of acts are for sorrow in spite of the apparent character of some; and that the fruits of acts are varied, sometimes other fruits appearing than those expected. Hence, I do not indulge in sorrow, for I avoid acts and do not grieve for not obtaining the fruits of acts or for the accession of fruits other than those apparently agreeable.  </span></span> That for which men are said to be wise, indeed,<br>the very root of wisdom, is the freedom of the senses from error. It is<br>the senses that yield to error and grief. One whose senses are subject to<br>error can never be said to have attained wisdom. That pride which is<br>indulged in by a man subject to error is only a form of the error to<br>which he is subject. As regards the man of error, he has neither this<br>world nor the next. It should be remembered that griefs do not last for<br>ever and that happiness cannot be had always.<span class="footnote-tooltip" style="color:rgb(255,193,7);"><sup><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i></sup><span class="footnote-tooltip-text">The sense is that we who avoid acts, are not dead; in fact, we live quite as others do; and those others, how unequally circumstanced! The Burdwan translator makes nonsense of the first line simple though it is.  </span></span> Worldly life with all<br>its vicissitudes and painful incidents, one like me would never adopt.<br>Such a one would not care for desirable objects of enjoyments, and would<br>not think at all of the happiness their possession may bring about, or,<br>indeed, of the griefs that present themselves.<span class="footnote-tooltip" style="color:rgb(255,193,7);"><sup><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i></sup><span class="footnote-tooltip-text">Ignorance lies at the root of sorrow. By casting off ignorance, we have avoided sorrow. Hence, neither religion or religious acts such as Sacrifices, etc., can do us any good or harm. As regards happiness and misery again, these two cannot agitate us at all, since we know their value, both being ephemeral in comparison with the period for which we are to exist.  </span></span> One capable of<br>resting on one's own self would never covet the possessions of others;<br>would not think of gains unacquired, would not feel delighted at the<br>acquisition of even immense wealth; and would not yield to sorrow at the<br>loss of wealth. Neither friends, nor wealth, nor high birth, nor<br>scriptural learning, nor mantras, nor energy, can succeed in rescuing one<br>from sorrow in the next world. It is only by conduct that one can attain<br>to felicity there. The Understanding of the man unconversant with Yoga<br>can never be directed towards Emancipation. One unconversant with Yoga<br>can never have happiness. Patience and the resolution to cast off sorrow,<br>these two indicate the advent of happiness. Anything agreeable leads to<br>pleasure. Pleasure induces pride. Pride, again, is productive of sorrow.<br>For these reasons, I avoid all these. Grief, Fear, Pride,&#8212;these that<br>stupefy the heart,&#8212;and also Pleasure and Pain, I behold as (an<br>unconcerned) witness since my body is endued with life and moves<br>about.<span class="footnote-tooltip" style="color:rgb(255,193,7);"><sup><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i></sup><span class="footnote-tooltip-text">Hence, no one should indulge in pride, saying, 'I am happy,' nor yield to sorrow, saying, 'I am miserable.' Both happiness and misery are transitory. The man of wisdom should never suffer himself to be agitated by these transitory states of his mind.  </span></span> Casting off both wealth and pleasure, and thirst and error,<br>I wander over the earth, freed from grief and every kind of anxiety of<br>heart. Like one that has drunk nectar I have no fear, here or hereafter,<br>of death, or iniquity, or cupidity, or anything of that kind. I have<br>acquired this knowledge, O Brahmana, as the result of my severe and<br>indestructible penances. It is for this reason, O Narada, that grief,<br>even when it comes to me, does not succeed in afflicting me.'"
