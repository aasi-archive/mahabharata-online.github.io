                            "Yudhishthira said, 'Tell his those duties in respect of persons like<br>ourselves which are auspicious, productive of happiness in the future,<br>benevolent, approved by all, pleasant, and agreeable.'<br><br>"Bhishma said, 'The four modes of life, O puissant one, have been laid<br>down for the Brahmana. The other three orders do not adopt them, O best<br>of the Bharatas! Many acts, O king, leading to heaven and especially fit<br>for the kingly order, have already been declared. Those, however, cannot<br>be referred to in reply to thy present query, for all of them have been<br>duly laid down for such Kshatriyas as are not disinclined to<br>pitilessness. The Brahmana who is addicted to the practices of Kshatriyas<br>and Vaisyas and Sudras, incurs censure in this world as a person of<br>wicked soul and goes to hell in the next world. Those names which are<br>applied among men to slaves and dogs and wolves and (other) beasts, are<br>applied, O son of Pandu, to the Brahmana who is engaged in pursuits that<br>are improper for him. That Brahmana who, in all the four modes of life.<br>is duly engaged in the six-fold acts (of regulating the breath,<br>contemplation, etc.), who performs all his duties, who is not restless,<br>who has his passions under control, whose heart is pure and who is ever<br>engaged in penances, who has no desire of bettering his prospects, and<br>who is charitable, has inexhaustible regions of bliss in the other world.<br>Everyone derives his own nature from the nature of his acts, in respect<br>of their circumstances, place, and means and motives. Thou shouldst,<br>therefore, O king, regard the study of the Vedas, which is fraught with<br>such high merit, to be equal with the exertion of kingly power, or the<br>pursuits of agriculture, trade, and hunting. The world is set agoing by<br>Time. Its operations are settled by the course of Time. Man does all his<br>acts, good, bad, and indifferent, entirely influenced by Time.<span class="footnote-tooltip" style="color:rgb(255,193,7);"><sup><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i></sup><span class="footnote-tooltip-text">The sense seems to be that influenced by past acts everyone acts in subsequent lives. If he is a hunter in this life, it is because the influence of many cruel acts of a past life pursues him even in this.  </span></span> Those<br>amongst the good acts of a man's past life that exert the greatest<br>influence on the next, are liable to be exhausted. Men, however, are<br>always engaged in those acts to which their propensities lead. Those<br>propensities, again, lead a living being to every direction.'"<span class="footnote-tooltip" style="color:rgb(255,193,7);"><sup><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i></sup><span class="footnote-tooltip-text">Men, therefore, have not always balances of good acts to their credit. These are, however, free agents; the new acts they do determine the character of their next lives.  </span></span>
