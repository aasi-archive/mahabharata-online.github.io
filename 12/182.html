                    "Yudhishthira said, 'Whence has this universe consisting of mobile and<br>immobile creatures been created? Whom does it go to when destruction sets<br>in? Tell me this, O grandsire! Indeed, by whom has this universe with its<br>oceans, its firmament, its mountains, its clouds, its lands, its fire,<br>and its wind, been created. How were all objects created? Whence this<br>division into separate orders of existence? Whence are their purity and<br>impurity, and the ordinances about virtue and vice? Of what kind is the<br>life of living creatures? Where also do they go who die. Tell us<br>everything about this and the other world.'<br><br>"Bhishma said, 'In this connection is cited the old narrative of the<br>sacred words that Bhrigu said in reply to the questions of Bharadwaja.<br>Beholding the great Rishi Bhrigu blazing with energy and splendour,<br>seated on the Kailasa summit, Bharadwaja addressed him in the following<br>words.'<br><br>"Bharadwaja said, 'By whom was this world with its ocean, its firmament,<br>its mountains, its clouds, its lands, its fire, and its wind, created?<br>How were all creatures first created? Whence this distinction of castes?<br>Whence the purity and the impurity of (behaviour), and whence the<br>ordinances about virtue and vice, for living creatures? Of what kind is<br>the life of living creatures? Where do they go who die? It behoveth thee<br>to tell me everything about this and the other world.' Thus addressed<br>about his doubts by Bharadwaja, the illustrious and regenerate Rishi<br>Bhrigu who resembled Brahma itself, replied unto him, saying these words.'<br><br>"Bhrigu said, 'There is a Primeval Being, known to the great Rishis, of<br>the name of Manasa. He is without beginning and without end. That Divine<br>Being is incapable of being penetrated by weapons. He is without decay<br>and is Immortal. He is said to be Unmanifest. He is Eternal, Undecaying,<br>and Unchangeable. Through Him are creatures born and through Him they<br>die. He first created a Divine Being known by the name of Mahat.<span class="footnote-tooltip" style="color:rgb(255,193,7);"><sup><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i></sup><span class="footnote-tooltip-text">This verse occurs in the Santi Parva. It is difficult to understand in what sense it is said that the track of the virtuous cannot be marked. Perhaps, it is; intended that such men do not leave any history or record behind them, they having abstained from all kinds of action good or bad.  </span></span><br>Mahat created Consciousness. That Divine Being created Space. That<br>puissant Being is the holder of all created objects. From Space was born<br>Water, and from Water were born Fire and Wind. Through the union of Fire<br>and Wind was born the Earth. Self-born Manasa then created a divine Lotus<br>pregnant with Energy. From that Lotus sprang Brahman, that Ocean of<br>Veda.<span class="footnote-tooltip" style="color:rgb(255,193,7);"><sup><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i></sup><span class="footnote-tooltip-text">Manasa means 'appertaining to the mind,' or rather, the Will. Mahat literally means great.  </span></span> The Srutis say that as soon as born, that divine Being uttered<br>the words, 'I am He!' For this He came to be called by the name of<br>Consciousness. He has all created things for his body and He is their<br>Creator.<span class="footnote-tooltip" style="color:rgb(255,193,7);"><sup><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i></sup><span class="footnote-tooltip-text">Veda is here used in the sense of Knowledge and Power.  </span></span> These five elements that we see are that Brahman of great<br>energy. The mountains are his bones. The earth is his fat and flesh. The<br>oceans are his blood. Space is his stomach. The Wind is his breath. Fire<br>is his energy. The rivers are his arteries and veins. Agni and Soma,<br>otherwise called the Sun and the Moon, are called his eyes. The firmament<br>above is his head. The earth is his two feet. The cardinal and subsidiary<br>points of the horizon are his arms. Without doubt, He is incapable of<br>being known and His Soul is inconceivable by even persons crowned with<br>ascetic success. The Divine Being, who pervades the whole universe, is<br>also known by the name of Ananta (Infinite). He lives in Consciousness,<br>and is incapable of being known by persons of uncleansed souls. Asked by<br>thee I have now told thee of Him who created Consciousness for evoking<br>into existence all created objects, and from whom this universe has<br>sprung.'<br><br>"Bharadwaja said, 'What is the extent of the firmament, of the points of<br>the horizon, of the surface of this earth, and of the Wind? By telling me<br>the truth, solve my doubts.'<br><br>"Bhrigu said, 'The sky thou seest above is Infinite. It is the abode of<br>persons crowned with ascetic success and of divine beings. It is<br>delightful, and consists of various regions. Its limits cannot be<br>ascertained. The Sun and the Moon cannot see, above or below, beyond the<br>range of their own rays. There where the rays of the Sun and the Moon<br>cannot reach are luminaries<span class="footnote-tooltip" style="color:rgb(255,193,7);"><sup><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i></sup><span class="footnote-tooltip-text">Sarvabhutatmakrit is explained by Nilakantha thus. He who is Sarvabhutatman is again bhutakrit. On the authority of the Srutis the commentator adds,--ye ete pancha akasadayodhatavo-dharana-karmanah sa eva Brahma.  </span></span> which are self-effulgent and which<br>possess splendour like that of the Sun or the fire. Know this, O giver of<br>honours, that possessed of far-famed splendour, even these last do not<br>behold the limits of the firmament in consequence of the inaccessibility<br>and infinity of those limits. This Space which the very gods cannot<br>measure is fall of many blazing and self-luminous worlds each above the<br>other. Beyond the limits of land are oceans of water. Beyond water is<br>darkness. Beyond darkness is water again, and beyond the last is fire.<br>Downwards, beyond the nether regions, is water. Beyond water is the<br>region belonging to the great snakes. Beyond that is sky once more, and<br>beyond the sky is water again. Even thus there is water and sky<br>alternately without end. Even such are the limits of the Divinity<br>represented by water. The very gods are unable to ascertain limits of<br>fire and wind and water. The nature of fire, wind, water, and land, is<br>like that of space. They are distinguished through want of true<br>Knowledge. Sages read in diverse scriptures the limits that have been<br>declared of the three worlds and the ocean. Who is there, however, that<br>would set limits to what cannot be grasped by vision and what is<br>inaccessible (in all its parts)? If even it becomes possible to ascertain<br>the limits of the firmament which is the track of the gods and beings<br>crowned with ascetic success, it can never be possible to set limits to<br>that which is limitless and known by the name of the Infinite, to that<br>which correspond with the name by which it is known, viz., what has been<br>called the high-souled Manasa? When again His form is sometimes<br>contracted and sometimes expanded, how can any one else except one that<br>is equal to Him, be able to comprehend His limits? From the Lotus (of<br>which I have already spoken) was first created the Omniscient lord,<br>Brahman, endued with form, of essence comprised of Righteousness, and the<br>Creator of all mobile and immobile things.<br><br>"Bharadwaja said, 'If Brahman sprang from the Lotus, then it is the Lotus<br>that should be regarded as the First-born and not Brahman. Why, however,<br>is Brahma said to be the first? Do thou remove that doubt of mine.'<br><br>"Bhrigu said, 'The Earth it is that is called the Lotus. It was created<br>for giving a seat unto that form of Manasa which became Brahman. Reaching<br>up to heaven itself, the Sumeru became the pericarp of the Lotus.<br>Remaining within it, the puissant Lord of the Universe created all the<br>worlds.'"
