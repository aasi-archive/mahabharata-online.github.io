                    "Bhishma said, 'I shall now tell thee what the means are (for conquering<br>the senses) as seen with the eye of the scriptures. A person, O king,<br>will attain to the highest end by the help of such knowledge and by<br>framing his conduct accordingly. Amongst all living creatures man is said<br>to be the foremost.<br><br>Among men, those that are regenerate have been called the foremost; and<br>amongst the regenerate, they that are conversant with the Vedas. These<br>last are regarded as the souls of all living creatures. Indeed, those<br>Brahmanas that are conversant with the Vedas are regarded as all-seeing<br>and omniscient. They are persons who have become conversant with Brahma.<br>As a blind man, without a guide, encounters many difficulties on a road,<br>so has a person destitute of knowledge to encounter many obstacles in the<br>world. For this reason, those that are possessed of knowledge are<br>regarded as superior to the rest. Those that are desirous of acquiring<br>virtue practise diverse kinds of rites according to the dictates of the<br>scriptures. They do not, however, succeed in attaining to Emancipation,<br>all that they gain being those good qualities of which I shall presently<br>speak.<span class="footnote-tooltip" style="color:rgb(255,193,7);"><sup><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i></sup><span class="footnote-tooltip-text">After indriyartham, as explained by the commentator, prapyapi is understood. There are two classes of indriyas, viz., those of knowledge and those for the performance of acts. Escapes the obligation of rebirth, i.e., attains to Emancipation.  </span></span> Purity of speech, of body, and of mind, forgiveness, truth,<br>steadiness, and intelligence,&#8212;these good qualities are displayed by<br>righteous persons observant of both kinds of religion. That which is<br>called Brahmacharya (religion of abstention or yoga) is regarded as the<br>means of attaining to Brahma. That is the foremost of all religions. It<br>is by the practice of that religion that one obtains the highest end<br>(viz., Emancipation). Brahmacharya is divested of all connection with the<br>five vital breaths, mind, understanding, the five senses of perception,<br>and the five senses of action. It is on that account free from all the<br>perceptions that the senses give. It is heard only as a word, and its<br>form, without being seen, can only be conceived. It is a state of<br>existence depending only on the mind. It is free from all connection with<br>the senses. That sinless state should be attained to by the understanding<br>alone. He that practises it duly attains to Brahma; he that practises it<br>half and half, attains to the condition of the gods; while he that<br>practises it indifferently, takes birth among Brahmanas and possessed of<br>learning attains to eminence. Brahmacharya is exceedingly difficult to<br>practise. Listen now to the means (by which one may practise it). That<br>regenerate person who betakes himself to it should subdue the quality of<br>Passion as soon as it begins to manifest itself or as soon as it begins<br>to be powerful. One that has betaken oneself to that vow should not speak<br>with women. He should never cast his eyes on an undressed woman. The<br>sight of women, under even indifferent circumstances, fills all<br>weak-minded men with Passion. If a person (while observing this vow)<br>feels a desire for woman rising in his heart, he should (as an expiation)<br>observe the vow called Krichcchra and also pass three days in water.<span class="footnote-tooltip" style="color:rgb(255,193,7);"><sup><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i></sup><span class="footnote-tooltip-text">Arthasamanyam is explained by Nilakantha as Phalasamyam Mokshakhyam niratisayam. The Burdwan translator, while using the very words of the commentator, mistranslates this verse: The speaker desires to show the difference between the religion of Pravritti or acts and that of Nivritti or abstention from acts. Those that follow the former cannot attain to Emancipation. What they gain are certain good qualities mentioned in the next verse, which, however, are equally gained by the followers of the religion of Nivritti.  </span></span><br>If desire is entertained in course of a dream, one should, diving in<br>water, mentally repeat for three times the three Riks by<br>Aghamarshana.<span class="footnote-tooltip" style="color:rgb(255,193,7);"><sup><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i></sup><span class="footnote-tooltip-text">The vow of Krichcchra consists of certain fasts. Pass three days in water, i.e., stand in tank or stream with water up to the chin.  </span></span> That wise man who has betaken himself to the practice<br>of this vow should, with an extended and enlightened mind, burn the sins<br>in his mind which are all due to the quality of Passion. As the duct that<br>bears away the refuse of the body is very closely connected with the<br>body, even so the embodied Soul is very closely connected with the body<br>that confines it. The different kinds of juices, passing through the<br>network of arteries, nourish men's wind and bile and phlegm, blood and<br>skin and flesh, intestines and bones and marrow, and the whole body. Know<br>that there are ten principal ducts. These assist the functions of the<br>five senses. From those ten branch out thousands of other ducts that are<br>minuter in form. Like rivers filling the ocean at the proper season, all<br>these ducts, containing juices nourish the body. Leading to the heart<br>there is a duct called Manovaha. It draws from every part of the human<br>body the vital seed which is born of desire. Numerous other ducts<br>branching out from that principal one extend into every part of the body<br>and bearing the element of heat cause the sense of vision (and the rest).<br>As the butter that lies within milk is churned up by churning rods, even<br>so the desires that are generated in the mind (by the sight or thought of<br>women) draw together the vital seed that lies within the body. In the<br>midst of even our dreams passion having birth in imagination assails the<br>mind, with the result that the duct already named, viz., Manovaha, throws<br>out the vital seed born of desire. The great and divine Rishi Atri is<br>well-conversant with the subject of the generation of the vital seed. The<br>juices that are yielded by food, the duct called Manovaha, and the desire<br>that is born of imagination,&#8212;these three are the causes that originate<br>the vital seed which has Indra for its presiding deity. The passion that<br>aids in the emission of this fluid is, therefore, called Indriya. Those<br>persons who know that the course of vital seed is the cause of (that<br>sinful state of things called) intermixture of castes, are men of<br>restrained passions. Their sins are regarded to have been burnt off, and<br>they are never subjected to rebirth. He that betakes himself to action<br>simply for the purposes of sustaining his body, reducing with the aid of<br>the mind the (three) attributes (of Goodness, Passion, and Darkness) into<br>a state of uniformity, and brings at his last moments the vital breaths<br>to the duct called Manovaha, escapes the obligation of rebirth.<span class="footnote-tooltip" style="color:rgb(255,193,7);"><sup><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i></sup><span class="footnote-tooltip-text">The three Riks begin with Ritancha, Satyancha etc. Every Brahmana who knows his morning and evening prayers knows these three Riks well.  </span></span> The<br>Mind is sure to gain Knowledge. It is the Mind that takes the form of all<br>things. The minds of all high-souled persons, attaining to success<br>through meditation, become freed from desire, eternal, and luminous.<span class="footnote-tooltip" style="color:rgb(255,193,7);"><sup><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i></sup><span class="footnote-tooltip-text">"With the aid of the mind" means yoga Dehakarma means one whose acts are undertaken only for the purpose of sustaining the body, i.e., one who does no act that is not strictly necessary for supporting life; hence, as the commentator explains, one who is free from all propensities leading to external objects. Manovaham Pranan nudan, i.e., bringing to sending the vital breaths to the duct called Manovaha or Sushumna. Though a physical act, its accomplishment becomes possible only by a long course of penances consisting in the withdrawal of the mind from external objects. "Reducing the (three) attributes to a state of uniformity," as explained by the commentator, means arriving at Nirvikalpa, i.e., at that state of knowledge which is independent of the senses.  </span></span><br>Therefore, for destroying the mind (as mind), one should do only sinless<br>deeds and freeing oneself from the attributes of Passion and Darkness,<br>one is sure to attain to an end that is very desirable.<span class="footnote-tooltip" style="color:rgb(255,193,7);"><sup><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i></sup><span class="footnote-tooltip-text">The Knowledge here spoken of is that knowledge which is independent of the senses. What the speaker says is that such Knowledge is no myth but is sure to arise. When it arises, its possessor comes to know that the external world, etc., is only the mind transformed, like the sights seen and sounds heard and thoughts cherished in a dream. In the second line the results of that knowledge are declared. The mind of a Mahatma is mantra-siddha, i.e., has won success by the meditation of the initial mantra, or om; it is nitya, i.e., eternal, meaning probably that though the result of Maya or Avidya, it is no longer subject to rebirth; it is virajas, i.e., free from desire and passion, and lastly it is Jyotishmat or luminous, meaning Omniscient and Omnipotent. The commentator cites a passage from Vasishtha's treatise on yoga which declares the same results as consequent on the attainment of Knowledge. It is, of course, implied that in attaining to such a state, the mind as mind must be destroyed or merged into the Soul and the Soul, with knowledge only for its attribute, must exist. In the previous verse emancipation after death has been spoken of. In this jivan-mukti or emancipation in life is referred to.  </span></span> Knowledge<br>(ordinarily) acquired in younger days becomes weakened with decrepitude.<br>A person, however, of ripe understanding succeeds, through the auspicious<br>effects of past lives, in destroying his desires.<span class="footnote-tooltip" style="color:rgb(255,193,7);"><sup><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i></sup><span class="footnote-tooltip-text">"Freeing oneself from the attributes of Passion and Darkness", i.e., by practising the religion of abstention from acts.  </span></span> Such a person, by<br>transcending the bonds of the body and the senses like a traveller<br>crossing a path full of obstacles, and transgressing all faults he sees,<br>succeeds in tasting the nectar (of Emancipation).'"
