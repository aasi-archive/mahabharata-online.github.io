                            "Yudhishthira said, 'How, O Bharata, should a learned man adorned with<br>modesty behave, O chastiser of foes, when assailed with harsh speeches in<br>the midst of assemblies by an ignorant person swelling with conceit?'<span class="footnote-tooltip" style="color:rgb(255,193,7);"><sup><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i></sup><span class="footnote-tooltip-text">The true policy, therefore, is to wait for the time when the foe becomes weak.  </span></span><br><br>"Bhishma said, 'Listen, O lord of earth, how the subject has been treated<br>of (in the scriptures), how a person of good soul should endure in this<br>world the abusive speeches of persons of little intelligence. If a<br>person, when abused by another, do not yield to wrath, he is then sure to<br>take away (the merit of) all the good deeds that have been done by the<br>abuser. The endurer, in such a case, communicates the demerit of all his<br>own bad acts to the person who under the influence of wrath indulges in<br>abuse. An intelligent man should disregard an abusive language who<br>resembles, after all, only a Tittibha uttering dissonant cries.<span class="footnote-tooltip" style="color:rgb(255,193,7);"><sup><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i></sup><span class="footnote-tooltip-text">Mridustikshnena is better than Mridutikshnena.  </span></span> One<br>who yields to hate is said to live in vain. A fool may often be heard to<br>say, 'Such a respectable man was addressed by me in such words amid such<br>an assembly of men,' and to even boast of that wicked act. He would add,<br>'Abused by me, the man remained silent as if dead with shame. Even thus<br>does a shameless man boast of an act about which no one should boast.<br>Such a wretch among men should carefully be disregarded. The man of<br>wisdom should endure everything that such a person of little intelligence<br>may say. What can a vulgar fellow do by either his praise or his blame?<br>He is even like a crow that caws uselessly in the woods. If those who<br>accuse others by only their words could establish those accusations by<br>such means, then, perhaps, their words would have been regarded to be of<br>some value. As a fact, however, these words are as effective as those<br>uttered by fools invoking death upon them with whom they quarrel.<span class="footnote-tooltip" style="color:rgb(255,193,7);"><sup><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i></sup><span class="footnote-tooltip-text">A bird that is identified by Dr. Wilson with the Parra Jacana.  </span></span><br>That man simply proclaims his bastardy who indulges in such conduct and<br>words. Indeed, he is even like a peacock that dances while showing such a<br>part of his body as should be ever concealed from the view.<span class="footnote-tooltip" style="color:rgb(255,193,7);"><sup><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i></sup><span class="footnote-tooltip-text">In India, the commonest form of verbal abuse among ignorant men and women is 'Do thou meet with death,' or, 'Go thou to Yama's house.' What Bhishma says is that as these words are uttered in vain, even so the verbal accusations of wicked men prove perfectly abortive.  </span></span> A person<br>of pure conduct should never even speak with that wight of sinful conduct<br>who does not scruple to utter anything or do anything. That man who speak<br>of one's merits when one's eye is upon him and who speaks ill of one when<br>one's eye is withdrawn from him, is really like a dog. Such a person<br>loses all his regions in heaven and the fruits of any knowledge and<br>virtue that he may have.<span class="footnote-tooltip" style="color:rgb(255,193,7);"><sup><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i></sup><span class="footnote-tooltip-text">The Burdwan Pundits have totally misunderstood the first line of this verse. K.P. Singha has rendered it correctly.  </span></span> The man who speaks ill of one when one's<br>eye is not upon him, loses without delay the fruits of all his libations<br>on fire and of the gifts he may make unto even a hundred persons. A man<br>of wisdom, therefore, should unhesitatingly avoid a person of such sinful<br>heart who deserves to be avoided by all honest men, as he would avoid the<br>flesh of the dog. That wicked-souled wretch who proclaims the faults of a<br>high-souled person, really publishes (by that act) his own evil nature<br>even as a snake displays his hood (when interfered with by others). The<br>man of sense who seeks to counteract such a back-biter ever engaged in an<br>occupation congenial to himself, finds himself in the painful condition<br>of a stupid ass sunk in a heap of ashes. A man who is ever engaged in<br>speaking ill of others should be avoided like a furious wolf, or an<br>infuriated elephant roaring in madness, or a fierce dog. Fie on that<br>sinful wretch who has betaken himself to the path of the foolish and has<br>fallen away from all wholesome restraints and modesty, who is always<br>engaged in doing what is injurious to others, and who is regardless of<br>his own prosperity. If an honest man wishes to exchange words with such<br>wretches when they seek to humiliate him, he should be counselled in<br>these words: Do not suffer thyself to be afflicted. A wordy encounter<br>between a high and a low person is always disapproved by persons of<br>tranquil intelligence. A slanderous wretch, when enraged, may strike<br>another with his palms, or throw dust or chaff at another, or frighten<br>another by showing or grinding his teeth. All this is well known. That<br>man who endures the reproaches and slanders of wicked-souled wights<br>uttered in assemblies, or who reads frequently these instructions, never<br>suffers any pain occasioned by speech.'
