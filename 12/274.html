                            "Yudhishthira said, 'Thou hast said, O grandsire, the Emancipation is to<br>be won by means and not otherwise. I desire to hear duly what those means<br>are.'<br><br>"Bhishma said, 'O thou of great wisdom, this enquiry that thou hast<br>addressed to me and that is connected with a subtle topic, is really<br>worthy of thee, since thou, O sinless one, always seekest to accomplish<br>all thy objects by the application of means. That state of mind which is<br>present when one sets oneself to make an earthen jar for one's use,<br>disappears after the jar has been completed. After the same manner, that<br>cause which urges persons who regard virtue as the root of advancement<br>and prosperity ceases to operate with them that seek to achieve<br>Emancipation.<span class="footnote-tooltip" style="color:rgb(255,193,7);"><sup><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i></sup><span class="footnote-tooltip-text">By dharma here is meant nishkama dharma, for the fruits of sakama dharma are not eternal, heaven like all things else having an end.  </span></span> That path which leads to the Eastern Ocean is not the<br>path by which one can go to the Western Ocean. There is only one path<br>that leads to Emancipation. (It is not identical with any of those that<br>lead to arty other object of acquisition). Listen to me as I discourse on<br>it to thee in detail. One should, by practising forgiveness, exterminate<br>wrath, and by abandoning&#8212;all purposes, root out desire. By practising<br>the quality of Sattwa<span class="footnote-tooltip" style="color:rgb(255,193,7);"><sup><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i></sup><span class="footnote-tooltip-text">What is said in this verse is this: when a man wants an earthen jar, he works for creating one. When he has got one, he no longer finds himself in the same state of mind, his want having been satisfied. Similarly, with men desirous of heaven and earthly prosperity as the reward of virtue, the means is Pravritti or acts. This or these cease to operate with those who having acquired such virtue set themselves for the achievement of Emancipation, for with them the religion of Nivritti is all in all.  </span></span> one should conquer sleep. By heedfulness one<br>should keep off fear, and by contemplation of the Soul one should conquer<br>breath.<span class="footnote-tooltip" style="color:rgb(255,193,7);"><sup><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i></sup><span class="footnote-tooltip-text">i.e., by abandoning all kinds of idleness, as explained by the commentator.  </span></span> Desire, aversion, and lust, one should dispel by patience;<br>error, ignorance, and doubt, by study of truth. By pursuit after<br>knowledge one should avoid insouciance and inquiry after things of no<br>interest.<span class="footnote-tooltip" style="color:rgb(255,193,7);"><sup><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i></sup><span class="footnote-tooltip-text">i.e., by Yoga-meditation one should regulate and finally suspend one's breath. The Yogin can suspend all physical functions and yet live on from age to age.  </span></span> By frugal and easily digestible fare one should drive off<br>all disorders and diseases. By contentment one should dispel greed and<br>stupefaction of judgment, and all worldly concerns should be avoided by a<br>knowledge of the truth.<span class="footnote-tooltip" style="color:rgb(255,193,7);"><sup><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i></sup><span class="footnote-tooltip-text">Nidra here is explained as ananusandhana or the absence of inquisitiveness or curiosity. By pratibha is meant inquiry after improper things or things that are of no interest.  </span></span> By practising benevolence one should<br>conquer iniquity, and by regard for all creatures one should acquire<br>virtue. One should avoid expectation by the reflection that it is<br>concerned with the future; and one should cast off wealth by abandoning<br>desire itself. The man of intelligence should abandon affection by<br>recollecting that everything (here) is transitory. He should subdue<br>hunger by practising Yoga. By practising benevolence one should keep off<br>all ideas of self-importance, and drive off all sorts of craving by<br>adopting contentment. By exertion one should subdue procrastination, and<br>by certainty all kinds of doubt, by taciturnity, loquaciousness, and by<br>courage, every kind of fear.<span class="footnote-tooltip" style="color:rgb(255,193,7);"><sup><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i></sup><span class="footnote-tooltip-text">The truth is that the world is unreal and has no end.  </span></span> Speech and mind are to be subdued by<br>the Understanding, and the Understanding, in its turn, is to be kept<br>under control by the eye of knowledge. Knowledge, again, is to be<br>controlled by acquaintance with the Soul, and finally the Soul is to be<br>controlled by the Soul.<span class="footnote-tooltip" style="color:rgb(255,193,7);"><sup><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i></sup><span class="footnote-tooltip-text">Hunger is to be subdued by Yoga, i.e., by regulating the wind within the body. Doubt is to be dispelled by certainty; this implies that certain knowledge should be sought for by driving off doubt. The commentator thinks that this means that all sceptical conclusions should be dispelled by faith in the scriptures. By 'fear,' in this verse, is meant the source of fear, or the world. That is to be conquered by the conquest of the six, i.e., desire, wrath, covetousness, error, pride, and envy.  </span></span> This last is attainable by those that are<br>of pure-acts and endued with tranquillity of soul,<span class="footnote-tooltip" style="color:rgb(255,193,7);"><sup><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i></sup><span class="footnote-tooltip-text">What is laid down here is the same course of training that is indicated for Yoga. First, the senses are to be merged into the mind, then the mind is to be merged into the Understanding, then the Understanding is to be merged into the Soul or what is known as the Ego. This Ego is to be merged at last into the Supreme Soul. When the Ego is understood, it comes to be viewed as Brahma.  </span></span> the means being<br>the subjugation of those five impediments of Yoga of which the learned<br>speak. By casting off desire and wrath and covetousness and fear and<br>sleep, one should, restraining speech, practise what is favourable to<br>Yoga, viz., contemplation, study, gift, truth, modesty, candour,<br>forgiveness, purity of heart, purity in respect of food, and the<br>subjugation of the senses. By these one's energy is increased, sins are<br>dispelled, wishes crowned with fruition, and knowledge (of diverse kinds)<br>gained. When one becomes cleansed of one's sins and possessed of energy<br>and frugal of fare and the master of one's senses, one then, having<br>conquered both desire and wrath, seeks to attain to Brahma. The avoidance<br>of ignorance (by listening to and studying the scriptures), the absence<br>of attachment (in consequence of Renunciation) freedom from desire and<br>wrath (by adoption of contentment and forgiveness), the puissance that is<br>won by Yoga, the absence of pride and haughtiness, freedom from anxiety<br>(by subjugation of every kind of fear), absence of attachment of anything<br>like home and family,&#8212;these constitute the path of Emancipation. That<br>path is delightful, stainless, and pure. Similarly, the restraining of<br>speech, of body, and of mind, when practised from the absence of desire,<br>constitutes also the path of Emancipation.'"<span class="footnote-tooltip" style="color:rgb(255,193,7);"><sup><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i></sup><span class="footnote-tooltip-text">'Pure acts' are, of course, those that are included in 'Nishkama dharmah,' and 'tranquillity of soul' is the cleansing of the soul by driving away all passions and desires.  </span></span>
