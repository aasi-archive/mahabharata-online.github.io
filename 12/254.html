                    "Vyasa said, 'There is a wonderful tree, called Desire, in the heart of a<br>man. It is born of the seed called Error. Wrath and pride constitute its<br>large trunk. The wish for action is the basin around its foot (for<br>holding the water that is to nourish it). Ignorance is the root of that<br>tree, and heedlessness is the water that gives it sustenance. Envy<br>constitutes its leaves. The evil acts of past lives supply it with<br>vigour. Loss of judgment and anxiety are its twigs; grief forms its large<br>branches; and fear is its sprout. Thirst (after diverse objects) that is<br>(apparently) agreeable forms the creepers that twine round it on every<br>side. Excessively greedy men, bound in chains of iron, sitting around<br>that fruit-yielding tree, pay their adorations to it, in expectation of<br>obtaining its fruit.<span class="footnote-tooltip" style="color:rgb(255,193,7);"><sup><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i></sup><span class="footnote-tooltip-text">Pradhanam is Avidya or Ignorance. Viniyoga is Viparinama. The particle anu always interpreted as 'following' the scriptures or some special branch of knowledge that treats of the subject spoken of.  </span></span> He who, subduing those chains, cutteth down<br>that tree and seeks to cast off both sorrow and joy, succeeds in<br>attaining to the end of both.<span class="footnote-tooltip" style="color:rgb(255,193,7);"><sup><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i></sup><span class="footnote-tooltip-text">The correct reading is ayasaih meaning 'made of iron,' and not 'ayasaih.' K.P. Singha adheres to the incorrect reading. The chains of iron here are either the diverse longings cherished by worldly men, or, perhaps, the bodies with which men are invested.  </span></span> That foolish man who nourishes this<br>tree by indulgence in the objects of the senses is destroyed by those<br>very objects in which he indulges after the manner of a poisonous pill<br>destroying the patient to whom it is administered.<span class="footnote-tooltip" style="color:rgb(255,193,7);"><sup><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i></sup><span class="footnote-tooltip-text">The dual genitive duhkhayoh is used because worldly sukha also is regarded as duhkha. 'Tyajamannah' is equivalent to 'tyaktum ichccha.' It is an instance of hetau sanach.  </span></span> A dexterous<br>person, however, by the aid of Yoga, forcibly teareth up and cutteth with<br>the sword of samadhi, the far-reaching root of this tree.<span class="footnote-tooltip" style="color:rgb(255,193,7);"><sup><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i></sup><span class="footnote-tooltip-text">Yena is explained as Stryadina hetuna. 'Sah' is: Stryadih: Samrohati is: Vardhayati. 'Tam' is: Vardhakam.  </span></span> One who<br>knows that the end of all acts undertaken from only the desire of fruit<br>is rebirth or chains that bind, succeeds in transcending all sorrow. The<br>body is said to be a city. The understanding is said to be its mistress.<br>The mind dwelling within the body is the minister of that mistress whose<br>chief function is to decide. The senses are the citizen that are employed<br>by the mind (upon the service of the mistress). For cherishing those<br>citizens the mind displays a strong inclination for acts of diverse<br>kinds. In the matter of those acts, two great faults are observable,<br>viz., Tamas and Rajas.<span class="footnote-tooltip" style="color:rgb(255,193,7);"><sup><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i></sup><span class="footnote-tooltip-text">'Uddhriyate' is literally 'tears up.' The use of the word 'asina' suggests also 'cutting.' The root of the tree, of course, is Avidya or Ignorance.  </span></span> Upon the fruits of those acts rest those<br>citizens along with the chiefs of the city (viz., Mind, Understanding,<br>and Consciousness).<span class="footnote-tooltip" style="color:rgb(255,193,7);"><sup><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i></sup><span class="footnote-tooltip-text">K.P. Singha wrongly translates the first line. The Burdwan translator quotes the gloss without understanding it. The first half of the first line, literally rendered, is 'the senses are the mind-citizens,' meaning, as the commentator rightly explains, that they are citizens under the lead of the mind. 'Tadartham' means 'for the sake of the senses,' i.e., 'for cherishing them.' Prakritih is mahati kriya pravrittih, Tadartham is kriyaphalam, i.e., happiness or misery. The meaning, in brief, is this: the body is a city. The understanding is its mistress. The mind is her principal servitor. The senses are the citizens under the lead of the mind. In order to cherish the senses the mind engages in acts productive of visible and invisible fruits i.e., sacrifices and gifts, and the acquisition of houses and gardens, etc. Those acts are liable to two faults, viz., Rajas and Tamas. The senses (both in this life and the succeeding ones) depend upon the fruits (happiness or misery) of those acts.  </span></span> The two faults (already spoken of) live upon<br>the fruits of those acts that are accomplished by forbidden means. This<br>being the case, the understanding, which of itself is unconquerable (by<br>either Rajas or Tamas), descends to a state of equality with the mind (by<br>becoming as much tainted as the mind that serves it). Then again the<br>senses, agitated by the stained mind, lose their own stability. Those<br>objects again for whose acquisition the understanding strives (regarding<br>them to be beneficial) become productive of grief and ultimately Meet<br>with destruction. Those objects, after destruction, are recollected by<br>the mind, and accordingly they afflict the mind even after they are lost.<br>The understanding is afflicted at the same time, for the mind is said to<br>be different from the understanding only when the mind is considered in<br>respect of its chief function of receiving impressions about whose<br>certainty it is no judge. In reality, however, the mind is identical with<br>the understanding.<span class="footnote-tooltip" style="color:rgb(255,193,7);"><sup><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i></sup><span class="footnote-tooltip-text">The meaning is this: the senses, the mind, the understanding, etc., are all due to acts. These, therefore, are said to rest upon acts and draw their sustenance therefrom.  </span></span> The Rajas (productive of only sorrow and evil of<br>every kind) that is in the understanding then overwhelms the Soul itself<br>that lies over the Rajas-stained understanding like an image upon a<br>mirror.<span class="footnote-tooltip" style="color:rgb(255,193,7);"><sup><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i></sup><span class="footnote-tooltip-text">I expand the first line of 14 for giving the meaning clearly.  </span></span> It is the mind that first unites in friendship with Rajas.<br>Having united itself, it seizes the soul, the understanding, and the<br>senses (like a false minister seizing the king and the citizens after<br>having conspired with a foe) and makes them over to Rajas (with which it<br>has united itself).'"
