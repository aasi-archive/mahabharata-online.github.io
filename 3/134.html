                    "Ashtavakra said, 'O king, O leader of fierce legions, in this assembly<br>of monarchs of unrivalled power who have met together, I am unable to<br>find out Vandin, chief of the controversialists. But I am searching for<br>him, even as one doth for a swan on a vast expanse of water. O Vandin,<br>thou regardest thyself as the foremost of controversialists. When though<br>wilt engage with me in staking, thou wilt not be able to flow like the<br>current of a river. I am like a full-flaming fire. Be silent before me, O<br>Vandin! Do not awaken a sleeping tiger. Know that thou shalt not escape<br>unstung, after trampling on the head of a venomous snake, licking the<br>corners of its mouth with its tongue, and who hath been hurt by thy foot.<br>That weak man who, in pride of strength, attempts to strike a blow at a<br>mountain, only gets his hands and nails hurt, but no wound is left on the<br>mountain itself. As the other mountains are inferior to the Mainaka, and<br>as calves are inferior to the ox, so are all other kings of the earth<br>inferior to the lord of Mithila. And as Indra is the foremost of<br>celestials, and as the Ganga is the best of rivers, so thou alone art, O<br>king, the greatest of monarchs. O king, cause Vandin to be brought to my<br>presence.'<br><br>"Lomasa said, 'Saying this, O Yudhishthira, wroth with Vandin, Ashtavakra<br>thus thundered in the assembly, and addressed him in these words, 'Do<br>thou answer my questions, and I shall answer thine.' Thereat Vandin said,<br>'One only fire blazeth forth in various shapes; one only sun illumineth<br>this whole world; one only hero, Indra, the lord of celestials,<br>destroyeth enemies; and one only Yama is the sole lord of the Pitris.<span class="footnote-tooltip" style="color:rgb(255,193,7);"><sup><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i></sup><span class="footnote-tooltip-text">Ashtavakra comes to Janaka's sacrifice with the object of proving the unity of the Supreme Being. Vandin avails himself of various system of Philosophy to combat his opponent. He begins with the Buddhistic system. The form of the dialogue is unique in literature being that of enigmas and the latent meaning is in a queer way hid under the appearance of puerile and heterogeneous combinations of things.  Vandin opens the controversy by saying that as the number of each of these is one, so one only intellect is the lord, leader and guide of the senses.  </span></span><br>Ashtavakra said, 'The two friends, Indra and Agni, ever move together;<br>the two celestial sages are Narada and Parvata; twins are the<br>Aswinikumaras; two is the number of the wheels of a car; and it is as a<br>couple that husband and wife live together, as ordained by the<br>deity.'<span class="footnote-tooltip" style="color:rgb(255,193,7);"><sup><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i></sup><span class="footnote-tooltip-text">There is a Vedic revelation that two birds live together on a tree as friends--one of these eats the fruits and the other looks at the former. From this it is manifest that two are the lords, leaders, and guides of the senses. That there is a second faculty besides the intellect is also proved by the fact that in sleep when the intellect is inactive that faculty continues in action, for if it were not so we could not remember having slept, nor connect the state after awaking with that preceding sleep. Accordingly by citing the number two Ashtavakra assets that besides intellect there is another faculty--consciousness that these two are jointly the lords, leaders and guides of the senses and that they act together as Indra and Agni, etc.  </span></span> Vandin said, 'Three kinds of born beings are produced by<br>acts; the three Vedas together perform the sacrifice, Vajapeya; at three<br>different times, the Adhwaryus commence sacrificial rites; three is the<br>number of words: and three also are the divine lights.'<span class="footnote-tooltip" style="color:rgb(255,193,7);"><sup><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i></sup><span class="footnote-tooltip-text">By citing the number three Vandin means to say that as it is Acts that produce the three kinds of born beings, etc., so Acts are supreme and that everything else be it intellect alone, or intellect and consciousness together is subservient to Acts.  </span></span> Ashtavakra<br>said, 'Four are the Asramas of the Brahmanas; the four orders perform<br>sacrifices; four are the cardinal points; four is the number of letters;<br>and four also, as is ever known, are the legs of a cow.'<span class="footnote-tooltip" style="color:rgb(255,193,7);"><sup><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i></sup><span class="footnote-tooltip-text">Ashtavakra here advances the thesis that even if Acts be supreme still when the (fourth) or Supreme Being becomes manifest to the soul, it stands in no further needs to Acts.  </span></span> Vandin said,<br>'Five is the number of fires; five are the feet of the metre called<br>Punki; five are the sacrifices; five locks, it is said in the Vedas, are<br>on the heads of the Apsaras; and five sacred rivers are known in the<br>world.'<span class="footnote-tooltip" style="color:rgb(255,193,7);"><sup><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i></sup><span class="footnote-tooltip-text">By bringing in the quinquennial series, Vandin wishes to assert that the five senses are competent to cognise their respective objects and that besides these senses and their objects there is neither any other sense to perceive nor any other object of perception. He also cites the authority of the Veda according to which the Apsaras (or consciousness) have five "locks" on their hands--i.e., five objects of perception.  </span></span> Ashtavakra said. 'Six cows, it is asserted by some, and paid<br>as a gratuity on the occasion of establishing the sacred fire; six are<br>the seasons belonging to the wheel of time; six is the number of the<br>senses; six stars constitute the constellation Kirtika; and six, it is<br>found in all the Vedas, is the number of the Sadyaska sacrifice.'<span class="footnote-tooltip" style="color:rgb(255,193,7);"><sup><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i></sup><span class="footnote-tooltip-text">Besides the five senses Ashtavakra contends for an additional sense namely the Mind and accordingly cites the number six.  </span></span><br>Vandin said, 'Seven is the number of the domesticated animals; seven are<br>the wild animals; seven metres are used in completing a sacrifice; seven<br>are the Rishis, seven forms of paying homage are extant (in the world);<br>and seven, it is known, are the strings of the Vina.'<span class="footnote-tooltip" style="color:rgb(255,193,7);"><sup><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i></sup><span class="footnote-tooltip-text">Vandin admits the existence of the six senses but says that the soul experiences happiness and misery through those as well as through the intellect.  </span></span> Ashtavakra<br>said, 'Eight are the bags containing a hundred fold; eight is the number<br>of the legs of the Sarabha, which preyeth upon lions; eight Vasus, as we<br>hear, are amongst the celestials; and eight are the angles of yupa<br>(stake), in all sacrificial rites.'<span class="footnote-tooltip" style="color:rgb(255,193,7);"><sup><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i></sup><span class="footnote-tooltip-text">Ashtavakra advances an eighth element, namely, the knowledge of the ego.  </span></span> Vandin said, 'Nine is the number<br>of the mantras used in kindling the fire in sacrifices to the Pitris;<br>nine are the appointed functions in the processes of creation; nine<br>letters compose the foot of the metre, Vrihati; and nine also is ever the<br>number of the figures (in calculation).'<span class="footnote-tooltip" style="color:rgb(255,193,7);"><sup><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i></sup><span class="footnote-tooltip-text">Each of the three qualities (existence, foulness and ignorance) of prakriti (the passive or material cause of the world) mixing with each of the three corresponding qualities of pradhana (the active or spiritual cause of the world) in various proportions produces the mundane order of things. Thus is proved the eternity of prakriti or nature and is also established the doctrine of duality.  </span></span> Ashtavakra said, 'Ten is<br>said to be the number of cardinal points, entering into the cognition of<br>men in this world; ten times hundred make up a thousand; ten is the<br>number of months, during which women bear; and ten are the teachers of<br>true knowledge, and ten, the haters thereof, and ten again are those<br>capable of learning it.'<span class="footnote-tooltip" style="color:rgb(255,193,7);"><sup><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i></sup><span class="footnote-tooltip-text">Prakriti does not really create. It is the Supreme Being who through the medium of illusion in contract with the ten organs (viz., the five locomotive organs and the five organs of sense) makes manifest the system of things. Prakriti therefore has no real existence--her existence is only apparent in the real existence of the soul.  </span></span> Vandin said, 'Eleven are the objects<br>enjoyable by beings; eleven is the number of the yupas; eleven are the<br>changes of the natural state pertaining to those having life; and eleven<br>are the Rudras among the gods in heaven.'<span class="footnote-tooltip" style="color:rgb(255,193,7);"><sup><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i></sup><span class="footnote-tooltip-text">Yupas (stakes) mean here, feelings, etc, which keep men bound to the world. Rudras are those who makes others cry.  Vandin means to say that the soul is not essential free from the fetters of happiness and misery arising from the eleven objects of perception. In this world all men are subject to happiness and misery. We also hear that there are Rudras in heaven.  </span></span> Ashtavakra said, Twelve<br>months compose the year; twelve letters go to the composition of a foot<br>of the metre called Jagati; twelve are the minor sacrifices; and twelve,<br>according to the learned, is the number of the Adityas.'<span class="footnote-tooltip" style="color:rgb(255,193,7);"><sup><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i></sup><span class="footnote-tooltip-text">The supreme soul unaffected by happiness and misery really exists--but His existence is not susceptible of being proved--nor can the ignorant ever perceive Him. Men attain that condition through these twelve, viz., virtue, true, self-restraint, penances, good-will, modesty, forgiveness, exemption from envy, sacrifice, charity, concentration and control over the senses.  </span></span> Vandin said,<br>'The thirteenth lunar day is considered the most auspicious; thirteen<br>islands exist on earth.<span class="footnote-tooltip" style="color:rgb(255,193,7);"><sup><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i></sup><span class="footnote-tooltip-text">According to some, endeavours to attain emancipation can be successful not in this world but in the world of Brahma. Others say that to that end a special yoga is necessary. By bringing forward the objects numbering thirteen. Vandin advances the opinion that, virtue, etc., are not sufficient for purposes of emancipation but that suitable time and place are also essential.  </span></span><br><br>Lomasa said, 'Having proceeded thus far, Vandin stopped. Thereupon<br>Ashtavakra supplied the latter half of the sloka. Ashtavakra said,<br>'Thirteen sacrifices are presided over by Kesi; and thirteen are devoured<br>by Atichhandas, (the longer metres) of the Veda.<span class="footnote-tooltip" style="color:rgb(255,193,7);"><sup><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i></sup><span class="footnote-tooltip-text">Ashtavakra concludes by citing the same number thirteen. The soul which is essentially unaffected, becomes subject to happiness and misery through, the thirteen, viz., the ten organs of locomotion and sense, and intellect mind and egoism. But Atichhanadas, i.e., those that have surmounted ignorance, namely, the twelve, virtue, etc. destroy those thirteen and that is emancipation.  </span></span> And seeing<br>Ashtavakra speaking and the Suta's son silent, and pensive, and with head<br>downcast, the assembly broke into a long uproar. And when the tumult thus<br>arose in the splendid sacrifice performed by king Janaka, the Brahmanas<br>well pleased, and with joined hands, approached Ashtavakra, and began to<br>pay him homage.'<br><br>"Thereupon Ashtavakra said, 'Before this, this man, defeating the<br>Brahmanas in controversy, used to cast them into water. Let Vandin today<br>meet with the same fate. Seize him and drown him in water.' Vandin said.<br>'O Janaka, I am the son of king Varuna. Simultaneously with thy<br>sacrifice, there also hath commenced a sacrifice extending over twelve<br>years. It is for this that I have despatched the principal Brahmanas<br>thither. They have gone to witness Varuna's sacrifice. Lo! there they are<br>returning. I pay homage to the worshipful Ashtavakra, by whose grace<br>to-day I shall join him who hath begot me.'<br><br>"Ashtavakra said, 'Defeating the Brahmanas either by words or subtlety.<br>Vandin had cast them into the waters of the sea. (That Vedic truth which<br>he had suppressed by false arguments), have I to-day rescued by dint of<br>my intellect. Now let candid men judge. As Agni, who knoweth the<br>character of both the good and the bad, leaveth unscorched by his heat<br>the bodies of those whose designs are honest, and is thus partial to<br>them, so good men judge the assertions of boys, although lacking the<br>power of speech, and are favourably disposed towards them. O Janaka, thou<br>hearest my words as if thou hast been stupefied in consequence of having<br>eaten the fruit of the Sleshmataki tree. Or flattery hath robbed thee of<br>thy sense, and for this it is that although pierced by my words as an<br>elephant (by the hook), thou hearest them not.'<br><br>"Janaka said, 'Listening to thy words, I take them to be excellent and<br>superhuman. Thy form also standeth manifest as superhuman. As thou hast<br>to-day defeated Vandin in discussion, I place even him at thy disposal.'<br>Ashtavakra said, 'O king, Vandin remaining alive, will not serve any<br>purpose of mine. If his father be really Varuna, let him be drowned in<br>the sea.'<br><br>Vandin said, 'I am King Varuna's son. I have no fear (therefore) in being<br>drowned. Even at this moment. Ashtavakra shall see his long-lost sire,<br>Kahoda.'<br><br>"Lomasa said, 'Then rose before Janaka all the Brahmanas, after having<br>been duly worshipped by the magnanimous Varuna. Kahoda said, 'It is for<br>this, O Janaka, that men pray for sons, by performing meritorious acts.<br>That in which I had failed hath been achieved by my son. Weak persons may<br>have sons endued with strength; dunces may have intelligent sons; and the<br>illiterate may have sons possessed of learning.' Vandin said, 'It is with<br>thy sharpened axe, O monarch, that even Yama severeth the heads of foes.<br>May prosperity attend thee! In this sacrifice of king Janaka, the<br>principal hymns relating to the Uktha rites are being chanted, and the<br>Soma juice also is being adequately quaffed. And the gods themselves, in<br>person, and with cheerful hearts, are accepting their sacred shares.'<br><br>"Lomasa said, 'When in enhanced splendour, the Brahmanas had risen up,<br>Vandin, taking king Janaka's permission, entered into the waters of the<br>sea. And then Ashtavakra worshipped his father, and he himself also was<br>worshipped by the Brahmanas. And having thus defeated the Suta's son.<span class="footnote-tooltip" style="color:rgb(255,193,7);"><sup><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i></sup><span class="footnote-tooltip-text">Su means excellent, and uta, sacrifice. The compound accordingly means,--performer of excellent sacrifice.  </span></span><br>Ashtavakra returned to his own excellent hermitage, in company with his<br>uncle. Then in the presence of his mother, his father addressed him,<br>saying, '(O son), thou speedily enter into this river, Samanga.' And<br>accordingly, he entered (into the water). (And as he plunged beneath the<br>water), all his (crooked) limbs were immediately made straight. And from<br>that day that river came to be called Samanga and she became invested<br>with the virtues of purifying (sins). He that shall bathe in her, will be<br>freed from his sins. Therefore, O Yudhishthira, do thou with thy brothers<br>and wife descend to the river, and perform thy ablutions. O Kunti's son,<br>O scion of the Ajamidha race, living happily and cheerfully at this place<br>together with thy brothers and the Brahmanas, thou wilt perform with me<br>other acts of merit, being intent upon good deeds.'"
