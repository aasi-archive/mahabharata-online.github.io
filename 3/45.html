                    Vaisampayana said, "One day, knowing that Arjuna's glances were cast upon<br>Urvasi, Vasava, calling Chitrasena to himself, addressed him in private<br>saying, 'O king of Gandharvas, I am pleased; go thou as my messenger to<br>that foremost of Apsaras, Urvasi, and let her wait upon that tiger among<br>men, Phalguna. Tell her, saying these words of mine, 'As through my<br>instrumentality Arjuna hath learnt all the weapons and other arts,<br>worshipped by all, so shouldst thou make him conversant with the arts of<br>acquitting one's self in female company.' Thus addressed by Indra, the<br>chief of the Gandharvas in obedience to that command of Vasava, soon went<br>to Urvasi that foremost of Apsaras. And as he saw her, she recognised him<br>and delighted him by the welcome she offered and the salutation she gave.<br>And seated at ease he then smilingly addressed Urvasi, who also was<br>seated at ease, saying, 'Let it be known, O thou of fair hips, that I<br>come hither despatched by the one sole lord of heaven who asketh of thee<br>a favour. He who is known amongst gods and men for his many inborn<br>virtues, for his grace, behaviour, beauty of person, vows and<br>self-control; who is noted for might and prowess, and respected by the<br>virtuous, and ready-witted; who is endued with genius and splendid<br>energy, is of a forgiving temper and without malice of any kind; who hath<br>studied the four Vedas with their branches, and the Upanishads, and the<br>Puranas also; who is endued with devotion to his preceptors and with<br>intellect possessed of the eight attributes, who by his abstinence,<br>ability, origin and age, is alone capable of protecting the celestial<br>regions like Mahavat himself; who is never boastful; who showeth proper<br>respect to all; who beholdeth the minutest things as clearly as if those<br>were gross and large; who is sweet-speeched; who showereth diverse kinds<br>of food and drink on his friends and dependents; who is truthful,<br>worshipped of all, eloquent, handsome, and without pride; who is kind to<br>those devoted to him, and universally pleasing and dear to all; who is<br>firm in promise; who is equal to even Mahendra and Varuna in respect of<br>every desirable attribute, viz., Arjuna, is known to thee. O Urvasi, know<br>thou that hero is to be made to taste the joys of heaven. Commanded by<br>Indra, let him today obtain thy feet. Do this, O amiable one, for<br>Dhananjaya is inclined to thee.'<br><br>"Thus addressed, Urvasi of faultless features assumed a smiling face, and<br>receiving the words of the Gandharva with high respect, answered with a<br>glad heart, saying, 'Hearing of the virtues that should adorn men, as<br>unfolded by thee, I would bestow my favours upon any one who happened to<br>possess them. Why should I not then, choose Arjuna for a lover? At the<br>command of Indra, and for my friendship for thee, and moved also by the<br>numerous virtues of Phalguna, I am already under the influence of the god<br>of love. Go thou, therefore, to the place thou desirest. I shall gladly<br>go to Arjuna.'"
