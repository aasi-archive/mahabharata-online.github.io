                    Vaisampayana continued, "The princess Draupadi, thus questioned by that<br>ornament of Sivi's race, moved her eyes gently, and letting go her hold<br>of the Kadamva blanch and arranging her silken apparel she said, I am<br>aware, O prince, that it is not proper for a person like me to address<br>you thus, but as there is not another man or woman here to speak with<br>thee and as I am alone here just now, let me, therefore, speak. Know,<br>worthy sir, that being alone in this forest here, I should not speak unto<br>thee, remembering the usages of my sex. I have learned, O Saivya, that<br>thou art Suratha's son, whom people know by the name of Kotika.<br>Therefore, on my part, I shall now tell thee of my relations and renowned<br>race. I am the daughter of king Drupada, and people know me by the name<br>of Krishna, and I have accepted as my husbands, five persons of whom you<br>may have heard while they were living at Kahandavaprastha. Those noble<br>persons, viz., Yudhishthira, Bhimasena, Arjuna, and the two sons of<br>Madri, leaving me here and having assigned unto themselves the four<br>points of the horizon, have gone out on a hunting excursion. The king<br>hath gone to the east, Bhimasena towards the south, Arjuna to the west,<br>and the twin brothers towards the north! Therefore, do ye now alight and<br>dismiss your carriages so that ye may depart after receiving a due<br>welcome from them. The high-souled son of Dharma is fond of guests and<br>will surely be delighted to see you!' Having addressed Saivya's son in<br>this way, the daughter of Drupada, with face beautiful as the moon,<br>remembering well her husband's character for hospitality, entered her<br>spacious cottage."
