                    Markandeya continued, 'O ornament of Kuru's race, he (Angiras) who was<br>the third son of Brahma had a wife of the name of Subha. Do thou hear of<br>the children he had by her. His son Vrihaspati, O king, was very famous,<br>large-hearted and of great bodily vigour. His genius and learning were<br>profound, and he had a great reputation as a counsellor. Bhanumati was<br>his first-born daughter. She was the most beautiful of all his children.<br>Angiras's second daughter was called Raga.<span class="footnote-tooltip" style="color:rgb(255,193,7);"><sup><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i></sup><span class="footnote-tooltip-text">Raga means love.  </span></span> She was so named because<br>she was the object of all creature's love. Siniwali was the third<br>daughter of Angiras. Her body was of such slender make that she was<br>visible at one time and invisible at another; and for this reason she was<br>likened to Rudra's daughter. Archismati was his fourth daughter, she was<br>so named from her great refulgence. And his fifth daughter was called<br>Havishmati, so named from her accepting havis or oblations. The sixth<br>daughter of Angiras was called Mahismati the pious. O keen-witted being,<br>the seventh daughter of Angiras is known by the name of Mahamati, who is<br>always present at sacrifices of great splendour, and that worshipful<br>daughter of Angiras, whom they call unrivalled and without portion, and<br>about whom people utter the words kuhu kuhu wonder, is known by the name<br>of Kuhu.'
