                    "Vrihadaswa said, 'After the snake had vanquished, Nala, the ruler of the<br>Nishadhas, proceeded, and on the tenth day entered the city of Rituparna.<br>And he approached the king, saying, 'My name is Vahuka. There is no one<br>in this world equal to me in managing steeds. My counsel also should be<br>sought in matters of difficulty and in all affairs of skill. I also<br>surpass others in the art of cooking. In all those arts that exists in<br>this world, and also in every thing difficult of accomplishment, I will<br>strive to attain success, O Rituparna, do thou maintain me.' And<br>Rituparna replied, 'O Vahuka, stay with me! May good happen to thee. Thou<br>wilt even perform all this. I have always particularly desired to be<br>driven fast. Do thou concert such measures that my steeds may become<br>fleet. I appoint thee the superintendent of my stables. Thy pay shall be<br>ten thousand (coins). Both Varshneya and Jivala shall always be under thy<br>direction. Thou wilt live pleasantly in their company. Therefore, O<br>Vahuka, stay thou with me.'"<br><br>"Vrihadaswa continued, 'Thus addressed by the king, Nala began to dwell<br>in the city of Rituparna, treated with respect and with Varshneya and<br>Jivala as his companions. And residing there, the king (Nala),<br>remembering the princess of Vidarbha, recited every evening the following<br>sloka: 'Where lieth that helpless one afflicted with hunger and thirst<br>and worn with toil, thinking of that wretch? And upon whom also doth she<br>now wait?' And once as the king was reciting this in the night, Jivala<br>asked him saying, 'O Vahuka, whom dost thou lament thus daily? I am<br>curious to hear it. O thou blest with length of days, whose spouse is she<br>whom thus lamentest?' Thus questioned, king Nala answered him, saying, 'A<br>certain person devoid of sense had a wife well-known to many. That wretch<br>was false in his promises. For some reason that wicked person was<br>separated from her. Separated from her, that wretch wandered about<br>oppressed with woe, and burning with grief he resteth not by day or<br>night. And at night, remembering her, he singeth this sloka. Having<br>wandered over the entire world, he hath at last found a refuge, and<br>undeserving of the distress that hath befallen him, passeth his days,<br>thus remembering his wife. When calamity had overtaken this man, his wife<br>followed him into the woods. Deserted by that man of little virtue, her<br>life itself is in danger. Alone, without knowledge of ways, ill able to<br>bear distress, and fainting with hunger and thirst, the girl can hardly<br>protect her life. And, O friend, she hath been deserted by that man of<br>small fortune and having little sense, with the wide and terrible forest,<br>ever abounding in beasts of prey'&#8212;<br><br>"Thus remembering Damayanti, the king of the Nishadhas continued to live<br>unknown in the abode of that monarch!"
