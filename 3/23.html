                    Vaisampayana continued, "After the chief of the Dasharhas had departed,<br>the heroic Yudhishthira, and Bhima, and Arjuna, and the twins, each<br>looking like unto Shiva, and Krishna, and their priest, ascending costly<br>cars unto which were yoked excellent steeds, together went into the<br>forest. And at time of going they distributed Nishkas of gold and clothes<br>and kine unto Brahmanas versed in Siksha and Akshara and mantras. And<br>twenty attendants followed them equipped with bows, and bowstrings, and<br>blazing weapons, and shafts and arrows and engines of destruction. And<br>taking the princess's clothes and the ornaments, and the nurses and the<br>maid-servants, Indrasena speedily followed the princes on a car. And then<br>approaching the best of Kurus, the high-minded citizens walked round him.<br>And the principal Brahmanas of Kurujangala cheerfully saluted him. And<br>together with his brothers, Yudhishthira the just, on his part saluted<br>them cheerfully. And the illustrious king stopped there a little,<br>beholding the concourse of the inhabitants of Kurujangala. And the<br>illustrious bull among the Kurus felt for them as a father feeleth for<br>his sons, and they too felt for the Kuru chief even as sons feel for<br>their father! And that mighty concourse, approaching the Kuru hero, stood<br>around him. And, O king, affected, with bashfulness, and with tears in<br>their eyes, they all exclaimed, 'Alas, O lord! O Dharma!' And they said,<br>'Thou art the chief of the Kurus, and the king of us, thy subjects! Where<br>dost thou go, O just monarch, leaving all these citizens and the<br>inhabitants of the country, like a father leaving his sons? Fie on the<br>cruel-hearted son of Dhritarashtra! Fie on the evil-minded son of Suvala!<br>Fie on Karna! For, O foremost of monarchs, those wretches ever wish unto<br>thee who art firm in virtue! Having thyself established the unrivalled<br>city of Indraprastha of the splendour of Kailasa itself, where dost thou<br>go, leaving it, O illustrious and just king, O achiever of extraordinary<br>deeds! O illustrious one, leaving that peerless palace built by Maya,<br>which possesseth the splendour of the palace of the celestials<br>themselves, and is like unto a celestial illusion, ever guarded by the<br>gods, where dost thou go, O son of Dharma?' And Vibhatsu knowing the ways<br>of virtue, pleasure, and profit said unto them in a loud voice, 'Living<br>in the forest, the king intendeth to take away the good name of his<br>enemies! O we with the regenerate ones at your head, versed in virtue and<br>profit, do you approaching the ascetics separately and inclining them to<br>grace, represent unto them what may be for our supreme good!' Upon<br>hearing these words of Arjuna, the Brahmanas and the other orders, O<br>king, saluting him cheerfully walked round the foremost of virtuous men!<br>And bidding farewell unto the son of Pritha, and Vrikodara, and<br>Dhananjaya and Yajnaseni, and the twins, and commanded by Yudhishthira,<br>they returned to their respective abodes in the kingdom with heavy<br>hearts."
