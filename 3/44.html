                    Vaisampayana said, "The gods and the Gandharvas then, understanding the<br>wishes of India, procured an excellent Arghya and reverenced the son of<br>Pritha in a hurry. And giving water to wash both his feet and face, they<br>caused the prince to enter the palace of Indra. And thus worshipped,<br>Jishnu continued to live in the abode of his father. And the son of Pandu<br>continued all the while to acquire celestial weapons, together with the<br>means of withdrawing them. And he received from the hands of Sakra his<br>favourite weapon of irresistible force, viz., the thunder-bolt and those<br>other weapons also, of tremendous roar, viz., the lightnings of heaven,<br>whose flashes are inferable from the appearance of clouds and (the<br>dancing of) peacocks. And the son of Pandu, after he had obtained those<br>weapons, recollected his brothers. And at the command of Indra, however,<br>he lived for full five years in heaven, surrounded by every comfort and<br>luxury.<br><br>"After some time, when Arjuna had obtained all the weapons. Indra<br>addressed him in due time, saying, 'O son of Kunti, learn thou music and<br>dancing from Chitrasena. Learn the instrumental music that is current<br>among the celestials and which existeth not in the world of men, for, O<br>son of Kunti, it will be to thy benefit. And Purandara gave Chitrasena as<br>a friend unto Arjuna. And the son of Pritha lived happily in peace with<br>Chitrasena. And Chitrasena instructed Arjuna all the while in music;<br>vocal and instrumental and in dancing. But the active Arjuna obtained no<br>peace of mind, remembering the unfair play at dice of Sakuni, the son of<br>Suvala, and thinking with rage of Dussasana and his death. When however,<br>his friendship with Chitrasena had ripened fully, he at times learned the<br>unrivalled dance and music practised among the Gandharvas. And at last<br>having learnt various kinds of dance and diverse species of music, both<br>vocal and instrumental, that slayer of hostile heroes obtained no peace<br>of mind remembering his brothers and mother Kunti."
