                    "Lomasa continued, 'When Agastya thought that girl to be competent for<br>the duties of domesticity, he approached that lord of earth-the ruler of<br>Vidharbhas-and addressing him, said, 'I solicit thee, O king, to bestow<br>thy daughter Lopamudra on me.' Thus addressed by the Muni, the king of<br>the Vidharbhas swooned away. And though unwilling to give the Muni his<br>daughter, he dared not refuse. And that lord of earth then, approaching<br>his queen, said, 'This Rishi is endued with great energy. If angry, he<br>may consume me with the fire of his curse. O thou of sweet face, tell me<br>what is thy wish." Hearing these words of the king, she uttered not a<br>word. And beholding the king along with the queen afflicted with sorrow,<br>Lopamudra approached them in due time and said, O monarch, it behoveth<br>thee not to grieve on my account. Bestow me on Agastya, and, O father,<br>save thyself, by giving me away.' And at these words of his daughter, O<br>monarch, the king gave away Lopamudra unto the illustrious Agastya with<br>due rites. And obtaining her as wife, Agastya addressed Lopamudra,<br>saying, 'Cast thou away these costly robes and ornaments.' And at these<br>words of her lord, that large-eyed damsel of thighs tapering as the stem<br>of the plantain tree cast away her handsome and costly robes of fine<br>texture. And casting them away she dressed herself in rags and barks and<br>deerskins, and became her husband's equal in vows and acts. And<br>proceeding then to Gangadwara that illustrious and best of Rishis began<br>to practise the severest penances along with his helpful wife. And<br>Lopamudra herself, well pleased, began to serve her lord from the deep<br>respect that she bore him. And the exalted Agastya also began to manifest<br>great love for his wife.<br><br>"After a considerable time, O king, the illustrious Rishi one day beheld<br>Lopamudra, blazing in ascetic splendour come up after the bath in her<br>season. And pleased with the girl, for her services, her purity, and self<br>control, as also with her grace and beauty, he summoned her for marital<br>intercourse. The girl, however, joining her hands, bashfully but lovingly<br>addressed the Rishi, saying, 'The husband, without doubt, weddeth the<br>wife for offspring. But it behoveth thee, O Rishi, to show that love to<br>me which I have for thee. And it behoveth thee, O regenerate one, to<br>approach me on a bed like to that which I had in the palace of my father.<br>I also desire that thou shouldst be decked in garlands of flowers and<br>other ornaments, and that I should approach thee adorned in those<br>celestial ornaments that I like. Otherwise, I cannot approach thee,<br>dressed in these rags dyed in red. Nor, O regenerate Rishi, it is sinful<br>to wear ornaments (on such an occasion).' Hearing these words of his<br>wife, Agastya replied, 'O blessed girl, O thou of slender waist, I have<br>not wealth like what thy father hath, O Lopamudra!' She answered saying,<br>'Thou who art endued with wealth of asceticism, art certainly able to<br>bring hither within a moment, by ascetic power, everything that exists in<br>the world of men.' Agastya said, 'It is even so as thou hast said. That,<br>however, would waste my ascetic merit. O bid me do that which may not<br>loosen my ascetic merit.' Lopamudra then said, 'O thou endued with wealth<br>of asceticism, my season will not last long, I do not desire, however, to<br>approach thee otherwise. Nor do I desire to diminish thy (ascetic) merit<br>in any way. It behoveth thee, however, to do as I desire, without<br>injuring thy virtue.'<br><br>"'Agastya then said, 'O blessed girl, if this be the resolve that thou<br>hast settled in thy heart, I will go out in quest of wealth. Meanwhile,<br>stay thou here as it pleaseth thee.'"
