                    Janamejaya said, "Having sent the heroic sons of Pandu into exile, these<br>lamentations, O Muni, of Dhritarashtra were perfectly futile. Why did the<br>king permit his foolish son Duryodhana to thus incense those mighty<br>warriors, the sons of Pandu? Tell us now, O Brahmana, what was the food<br>of the sons of Pandu, while they lived in the woods? Was it of the<br>wilderness, or was it the produce of cultivation?"<br><br>Vaisampayana said, "Those bulls among men, collecting the produce of the<br>wilderness and killing the deer with pure arrows, first dedicated a<br>portion of the food to the Brahmanas, and themselves are the rest. For, O<br>king, while those heroes wielding large bows lived in the woods, they<br>were followed by Brahmanas of both classes, viz., those worshipping with<br>fire and those worshipping without it. And there were ten thousand<br>illustrious Snataka Brahmanas, all conversant with the means of<br>salvation, whom Yudhishthira supported in the woods. And killing with<br>arrows Rurus and the black deer and other kinds of clean animals of the<br>wilderness, he gave them unto those Brahmanas. And no one that lived with<br>Yudhishthira looked pale or ill, or was lean or weak, or was melancholy<br>or terrified. And the chief of the Kurus&#8212;the virtuous king<br>Yudhishthira&#8212;maintained his brothers as if they were his sons, and his<br>relatives as if they were his uterine brothers. And Draupadi of pure fame<br>fed her husbands and the Brahmanas, as if she was their mother; and last<br>of all took her food herself. And the king himself wending towards the<br>east, and Bhima, towards the south, and the twins, towards the west and<br>the north, daily killed with bow in hand the deer of the forest, for the<br>sake of meat. And it was that the Pandavas lived for five years in the<br>woods of Kamyaka, in anxiety at the absence of Arjuna, and engaged all<br>the while in study and prayers and sacrifices."
