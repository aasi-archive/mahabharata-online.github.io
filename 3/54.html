                    "Vrihadaswa said, 'O Bharata, hearing those words of the swan, Damayanti<br>thenceforth lost all peace of mind on account of Nala. And heaving<br>frequent sighs she was filled with anxiety, and became melancholy and<br>pale-faced and lean. And with her heart possessed by the god of love, she<br>soon lost colour, and with her upturned gaze and modes of abstraction,<br>looked like one demented. And she lost all inclination for beds and seats<br>and object of enjoyment. And she ceased to lie down by day or night,<br>always weeping with exclamation of Oh! and Alas! And beholding her uneasy<br>and fallen into that condition, her hand-maids represented, O king, the<br>matter of her illness unto the ruler of Vidarbha by indirect hints. And<br>king Bhima, hearing of this from the handmaids of Damayanti, regarded the<br>affair of his daughter to be serious. And he asked himself, 'Why is it<br>that my daughter seemeth to be so ill now?' And the king, reflecting by<br>himself that his daughter had attained to puberty, concluded that<br>Damayanti's Swayamvara should take place. And the monarch, O exalted one,<br>(invited) all the rulers of the earth, saying, Ye heroes, know that<br>Damayanti's Swayamvara is at hand, And all the kings, hearing of<br>Damayanti's Swayamvara, came unto Bhima, agreeable to his message,<br>filling the earth with the clatter of their cars, the roar of their<br>elephants, and the neighing of their horses, and accompanied with their<br>fine-looking battalions decked in ornaments and graceful garlands. And<br>the mighty-armed Bhima paid due reverence unto those illustrious<br>monarchs. And duly honoured by him they took up their quarters there.'<br><br>"And at the juncture, those foremost of celestial Rishis possessed of<br>great splendour, of great wisdom and great vows&#8212;namely, Narada and<br>Parvata&#8212;having arrived in course of their wandering at the regions of<br>Indra entered the mansion of the lord of the immortals, receiving proper<br>worship. And Maghavat having worshipped them reverentially, inquired<br>after their undisturbed peace and welfare as regards all respects. And<br>Narada said, 'O lord, O divine one, peace attendeth us in every respect.<br>And, O Maghavat, peace attendeth also O exalted one, the kings of the<br>whole world.'<br><br>"Vrihadaswa continued. 'Hearing the words of Narada the slaver of Vala<br>and Vritra said, 'Those righteous rulers of the earth who fight<br>renouncing all desire of life, and who meet death when their time is come<br>by means of weapons, without flying from the field,&#8212;theirs is this<br>region, everlasting unto them and granting all desires, even as it is to<br>me. Where be those Kshatriya heroes? I do not see those kings approach<br>(now) Where are my favourite guests?' Thus addressed by Sakra, Narada<br>replied, 'Listen, O Mahavat, why seest not thou the kings (now)? The<br>ruler of the Vidarbhas hath a daughter&#8212;the celebrated Damayanti. In<br>beauty she transcendeth all the women of the earth. Her Swayamvara, O<br>Sakra, will take place shortly. Thither are going all the kings and<br>Princes from all directions. And all the lords of the earth desire to<br>have that pearl of the earth,&#8212;desire to have her eagerly, O slaver of<br>Vala and Vritra.' And while they were talking thus, those foremost of the<br>immortals, the Lokapalas with Agni among them, appeared before the lord<br>of the celestials. And all of them heard the words of Narada fraught with<br>grave import. And as soon as they heard them, they exclaimed in rapture,<br>We also will go there. And, O mighty monarch, accompanied by their<br>attendants and mounted on their (respective) vehicles, they set out for<br>the country of Vidarbhas, whither (had gone) all the kings. And, O son of<br>Kunti, the high-souled king Nala also hearing of that concourse of kings,<br>set out with a cheerful heart, full of Damayanti's love. And (it came to<br>pass) that the gods saw Nala on the way treading on the earth. And his<br>form owing to its beauty was like that of the god of love himself. And<br>beholding him resplendent as the sun, the Lokapalas were filled with<br>astonishment at his wealth of beauty, and abandoned their intention. And,<br>O king, leaving their cars in the sky the dwellers of heaven alighted<br>from the welkin and spake unto the ruler of the Nishadhas, saying, 'O<br>foremost of monarchs ruling the Nishadhas, O Nala, thou art devoted to<br>truth. Do thou help us. O best of men, be thou our messenger.'"
