                    (Pauloma Parva)<br><br>'UGRASRAVA SAUTI, the son of Lomaharshana, versed in the Puranas, while<br>present in the forest of Naimisha, at the twelve years' sacrifice of<br>Saunaka, surnamed Kulapati, stood before the Rishis in attendance. Having<br>studied Puranas with meticulous devotion and thus being thoroughly<br>acquainted with them, he addressed them with joined hands thus, 'I have<br>graphically described to you the history of Utanka which is one of the<br>causes of King Janamejaya's Snake-sacrifice. What, revered Sirs, do ye<br>wish to hear now? What shall I relate to you?' The holy men replied, 'O<br>son of Lomaharshana, we shall ask thee about what we are anxious to hear<br>and thou wilt recount the tales one by one. Saunaka, our revered master,<br>is at present attending the apartment of the holy fire. He is acquainted<br>with those divine stories which relate to the gods and asuras. He<br>adequately knoweth the histories of men, serpents, and Gandharvas.<br>Further, O Sauti, in this sacrifice that learned Brahmana is the chief.<br>He is able, faithful to his vows, wise, a master of the Sastras and the<br>Aranyaka, a speaker of truth, a lover of peace, a mortifier of the flesh,<br>and an observer of the penances according to the authoritative decrees.<br>He is respected by us all. It behoveth us therefore to wait for him. And<br>when he is seated on his highly respected seat, thou wilt answer what<br>that best of Dwijas shall ask of thee.'<br><br>"Sauti said, 'Be it so. And when the high-souled master hath been seated<br>I shall narrate, questioned by him, sacred stories on a variety of<br>subjects." After a while that excellent Brahmana (Saunaka) having duly<br>finished all his duties, and having propitiated the gods with prayers and<br>the manes with oblations of water, came back to the place of sacrifice,<br>where with Sauti seated before was the assembly of saints of rigid vows<br>sitting at ease. And when Saunaka was seated in the midst of the Ritwiks<br>and Sadhyas, who were also in their seats, he spake as followeth."
