                    (Astika Parva continued)<br><br>"Saunaka said, 'O son of a Suta, I desire to hear the names of all those<br>snakes that fell into the fire of this snake-sacrifice!'<br><br>"Sauti replied, 'Many thousands and tens of thousands and billions of<br>snakes fell into the fire. O most excellent Brahmana, so great is the<br>number that I am unable to count them all. So far, however, as I<br>remember, hear the names I mention of the principal snakes cast into the<br>fire. Hear first the names of the principal ones of Vasuki's race alone,<br>of colour blue, red and white of terrible form and huge body and deadly<br>poison. Helpless and miserable and afflicted with their mother's curse,<br>they fell into the sacrificial fire like libations of butter.<br><br>"Kotisa, Manasa, Purna, Cala, Pala Halmaka, Pichchala, Kaunapa, Cakra,<br>Kalavega, Prakalana, Hiranyavahu, Carana, Kakshaka, Kaladantaka&#8212;these<br>snakes born of Vasuki, fell into the fire. And, O Brahmana, numerous<br>other snakes well-born, and of terrible form and great strength, were<br>burnt in the blazing fire. I shall now mention those born in the race of<br>Takshaka. Hear thou their names. Puchchandaka, Mandalaka, Pindasektri,<br>Ravenaka; Uchochikha, Carava, Bhangas, Vilwatejas, Virohana; Sili,<br>Salakara, Muka, Sukumara, Pravepana, Mudgara and Sisuroman, Suroman and<br>Mahahanu. These snakes born of Takshaka fell into the fire. And Paravata,<br>Parijata, Pandara, Harina, Krisa, Vihanga, Sarabha, Meda, Pramoda,<br>Sauhatapana&#8212;these born in the race of Airavata fell into the fire. Now<br>hear, O best of Brahmanas, the names of the snakes I mention born in the<br>race of Kauravya: Eraka, Kundala Veni, Veniskandha, Kumaraka, Vahuka,<br>Sringavera, Dhurtaka, Pratara and Astaka. There born in the race of<br>Kauravya fell into the fire. Now hear the names I mention, in order, of<br>those snakes endued with the speed of the wind and with virulent poison,<br>born in the race of Dhritarashtra: Sankukarna, Pitharaka, Kuthara,<br>Sukhana, and Shechaka; Purnangada, Purnamukha, Prahasa, Sakuni, Dari,<br>Amahatha, Kumathaka, Sushena, Vyaya, Bhairava, Mundavedanga, Pisanga,<br>Udraparaka, Rishabha, Vegavat, Pindaraka; Raktanga, Sarvasaranga,<br>Samriddha, Patha and Vasaka; Varahaka, Viranaka, Suchitra, Chitravegika,<br>Parasara, Tarunaka, Maniskandha and Aruni.<br><br>"O Brahmana, thus I have recited the names of the principal snakes known<br>widely for their achievements&#8212;I have not been able to name all, the<br>number being countless. The sons of these snakes, the sons of those sons,<br>that were burnt having fallen into the fire, I am unable to mention. They<br>are so many! Some of three heads, some of seven, others of ten, of poison<br>like unto the fire at the end of the yuga and terrible in form,&#8212;they<br>were burnt by thousands!<br><br>"Many others, of huge bodies, of great speed, tall as mountain summits,<br>of the length of a yama, of a yojana, and of two yojanas, capable of<br>assuming at will any form and of mastering at will any degree of<br>strength, of poison like unto blazing fire, afflicted by the curse of a<br>mother, were burnt in that great 'sacrifice.'"
