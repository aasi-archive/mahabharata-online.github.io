                    (Astika Parva continued)<br><br>"Sauti said, 'O foremost of persons acquainted with Brahma, the mother of<br>the snakes had cursed them of old, saying, 'He that hath the Wind for his<br>charioteer (viz., Agni) shall burn you all in Janamejaya's sacrifice!' It<br>was to neutralise that curse that the chief of the snakes married his<br>sister to that high-souled Rishi of excellent vows. The Rishi wedded her<br>according to the rites ordained (in the scriptures), and from them was<br>born a high-souled son called Astika. An illustrious ascetic; versed in<br>the Vedas and their branches, he regarded all with an even eye, and<br>removed the fears of both his parents.<br><br>"Then, after a long space of time, a king descending from the Pandava<br>line celebrated a great sacrifice known as the Snake-sacrifice, After<br>that sacrifice had commenced for the destruction of the snakes, Astika<br>delivered the Nagas, viz., his brothers and maternal uncles and other<br>snakes (from a fiery death). And he delivered his fathers also by<br>begetting offspring. And by his austerities, O Brahmana, and various vows<br>and study of the Vedas, he freed himself from all his debts. By<br>sacrifices, at which various kinds of offerings were made, he propitiated<br>the gods. By practising the Brahmacharya mode of life he conciliated the<br>Rishis; and by begetting offspring he gratified his ancestors.<br><br>"Thus Jaratkaru of rigid vows discharged the heavy debt he owed to his<br>sires who being thus relieved from bondage ascended to heaven. Thus<br>having acquired great religious merit, Jaratkaru, after a long course of<br>years, went to heaven, leaving Astika behind. There is the story of<br>Astika that I have related duly Now, tell me, O tiger of Bhrigu's race,<br>what else I shall narrate."<br><br>So ends the fifteenth section in the Astika Parva of the Adi Parva.
