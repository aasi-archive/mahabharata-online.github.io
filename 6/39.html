                            [(Bhagavad Gita Chapter XV)]<br><br>"The Holy One said, 'They say that the Aswattha, having its roots above<br>and branches below, is eternal, its leaves are the Chhandas. He who<br>knoweth it, knoweth the Vedas.<span class="footnote-tooltip" style="color:rgb(255,193,7);"><sup><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i></sup><span class="footnote-tooltip-text">The 'Aswattha' is the sacred Indian fig tree, here emblematical of the course of worldly life. Its roots are above; those roots are the Supreme Being. Its branches are below, these being the inferior deities. Its leaves are the sacred hymns of the Vedas, i.e., as leaves keep the tree alive and even conduce to its fruits, so the Vedas support this tree and lead to salvation.  </span></span> Downwards and upwards are stretched<br>its branches which are enlarged by the qualities; its sprouts are the<br>objects of senses. Downwards its roots, leading to action, are extended<br>to this world of men.<span class="footnote-tooltip" style="color:rgb(255,193,7);"><sup><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i></sup><span class="footnote-tooltip-text">Upwards and downwards i.e., from the highest to the lowest of created things. Enlarged by the qualities, i.e., the qualities appearing as the body, the senses, etc. The sprouts are the objects of sense, being attached to the senses themselves as sprouts to branches. The roots extending downwards are the desires for diverse enjoyments. Thus Telang, following the commentators.  </span></span> Its form cannot here (below) be thus known,<br>nor (its) end, nor (its) beginning, nor (its) support. Cutting, with the<br>hard weapon of unconcern, this Aswattha of roots firmly fixed, then<br>should one seek for that place repairing whither one returneth not again<br>(thinking)&#8212;I will seek the protection of that Primeval Sire from whom<br>the ancient course of (worldly) life hath flowed.&#8212;Those that are free<br>from pride and delusion, that have subdued the evil of attachment, that<br>are steady in the contemplation of the relation of the Supreme to the<br>individual self, from whom desire hath departed, freed from the pairs of<br>opposites known by the names of pleasure and pain (and the like), repair,<br>undeluded, to that eternal seat. The sun lighteth not that [seat], nor<br>the moon, nor fire. Whither going none returneth, that is my supreme<br>seat. An eternal portion of Me is that which, becoming an individual soul<br>in the world of life, draweth to itself the (five) senses with the mind<br>as the sixth which all depend on nature. When the sovereign (of this<br>bodily frame) assumeth or quitteth (a) body, it departeth taking away<br>these, like the wind (taking away) perfumes from their seats. Presiding<br>over the ear, the eye, (the organs of) touch, taste, and smell, and also<br>over the mind, he enjoyeth all objects of senses. They that are deluded<br>do not see (him) when quitting or abiding in (the body), when enjoying or<br>joined to the qualities. They (however) see that have the eye of<br>knowledge.<span class="footnote-tooltip" style="color:rgb(255,193,7);"><sup><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i></sup><span class="footnote-tooltip-text">Joined to the qualities, i.e., perceiving objects of sense or experiencing pleasure and pain.  </span></span> Devotees exerting (towards that end) behold him dwelling<br>in themselves. They (however) that are senseless and whose minds are not<br>restrained, behold him not, even while exerting (themselves).<span class="footnote-tooltip" style="color:rgb(255,193,7);"><sup><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i></sup><span class="footnote-tooltip-text">"Atmani" in the first line is "in the body" as explained by Sreedhara and others: "in the understanding" as explained by Sankara. It seems, however, to be used in the general senses of "themselves", without particular reference to either body or understanding. An Akritatman is one whose soul is not made or formed; generally, "a person of unsubdued passions."  </span></span> That<br>splendour dwelling in the sun which illumines the vast universe, that<br>(which is) in the moon, and that (which is) in the fire, know that<br>splendour to be mine. Entering into the earth I uphold creatures by my<br>force; and becoming the juicy moon I nourish all herbs.<span class="footnote-tooltip" style="color:rgb(255,193,7);"><sup><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i></sup><span class="footnote-tooltip-text">There can be no question that Soma here means the moon and not the Soma juice quaffed in sacrifices, or sap. It is the moon that supports, nourishes all herbs and numerous passages may be quoted from Hindu sacred literature to show this. Mr. Davies, therefore, clearly errs in rendering Soma as "the savoury juice."  </span></span> Myself<br>becoming the vital heat (Vaiswanara) residing in the bodies of creatures<br>that breathe, (and) uniting with the upward and the downward<br>life-breaths, I digest the four kinds of food.<span class="footnote-tooltip" style="color:rgb(255,193,7);"><sup><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i></sup><span class="footnote-tooltip-text">The four kinds of food are: that which is masticated, that which is sucked, that which is licked, and that which is drunk.  </span></span> I am seated in the<br>hearts of all. From Me are memory and knowledge and the loss of both. I<br>am the objects of knowledge to be known by (the aid of) all the Vedas. I<br>am the author of the Vedantas, and I alone am the knower of the<br>Vedas.<span class="footnote-tooltip" style="color:rgb(255,193,7);"><sup><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i></sup><span class="footnote-tooltip-text">Apohanam is loss or removal. It is a well-known word and its application here is very natural. I am memory and knowledge (to those that use them for virtuous acts). I am the loss of these faculties (to those that engage in unrighteous acts). Mr. Davies erroneously renders it as "The power of reason."  </span></span> There are these two entities in the world, viz., the mutable<br>and the immutable. The mutable is all (these) creatures. The unchangeable<br>one is called the immutable.<span class="footnote-tooltip" style="color:rgb(255,193,7);"><sup><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i></sup><span class="footnote-tooltip-text">Kutashtha is rendered by K. T. Telang as "the unconcerned one", by Mr. Davies as "the lord on high." I incline to the scholiasts who explain it as "the uniform or the unchangeable one."  </span></span> But there is another, the Supreme<br>Being, called Paramatman, who was the Eternal Lord, pervading the three<br>worlds, sustaineth (them) (and) since I transcend the mutable, and am<br>higher than even the immutable; for this I am celebrated in the world<br>(among men) and in the Veda as Purushottama (the Highest Being). He who,<br>without being deluded, knoweth Me as this Highest Being,&#8212;he knowing all,<br>O Bharata, worshippeth Me in every way.<span class="footnote-tooltip" style="color:rgb(255,193,7);"><sup><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i></sup><span class="footnote-tooltip-text">Sarvabhavena is explained by Sankara by Sarvatma-chintaya (thinking Me to be the soul of everything). Sreedhara explains it as Sarvaprakarena. Why may it not mean "with the whole soul" or "with excess of love."  </span></span> Thus, O sinless one, hath<br>this knowledge, forming the greatest of mysteries, been declared by Me<br>(to thee). Knowing this, O Bharata, one will become gifted with<br>intelligence, and will have done all he needs do.'
