                    Sanjaya said,&#8212;"That arrowy shower, difficult of being borne by even the<br>Danavas, king Duryodhana, however, (quietly) bore in that battle, like a<br>gigantic elephant bearing a shower (from the blue).<span class="footnote-tooltip" style="color:rgb(255,193,7);"><sup><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i></sup><span class="footnote-tooltip-text">The last word of the second line is variously read. The Bengal reading is Mahadwijas Probably implying Garuda, the prince of birds. I have adopted the Bombay reading.  </span></span> Then filled with<br>anger and sighing like a snake, thy son, O bull of Bharata's race, was<br>placed in a position of great danger. He then shot five and twenty sharp<br>arrows of keen points. These, O king, fell with great force on that bull<br>among Rakshasas, like angry snakes of virulent poison on the breast of<br>Gandhamadana. Pierced with those shafts, blood trickled down the<br>Rakshasa's body and he looked like an elephant with rent temples.<span class="footnote-tooltip" style="color:rgb(255,193,7);"><sup><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i></sup><span class="footnote-tooltip-text">i.e., with temporal juice trickling down.  </span></span><br>Thereupon that cannibal set his heart upon the destruction of the (Kuru)<br>king. And he took up a huge dart that was capable of piercing even a<br>mountain. Blazing with light, effulgent as a large meteor, it flamed with<br>radiance like the lightning itself. And the mighty-armed Ghatotkacha,<br>desirous of slaying thy son, raised that dart. Beholding that dart<br>upraised, the ruler of the Vangas mounting upon an elephant huge as a<br>hill, drove towards the Rakshasa. On the field of battle, with the mighty<br>elephant of great speed, Bhagadatta placed himself in the very front of<br>Duryodhana's car. And with that elephant he completely shrouded the car<br>of thy son. Beholding then the way (to Duryodhana's car) thus covered by<br>the intelligent king of the Vangas, the eyes of Ghatotkacha, O king,<br>became red in anger. And he ruled that huge dart, before upraised, at<br>that elephant. Struck, O king, with that dart hurled from the arms of<br>Ghatotkacha, that elephant, covered with blood and in great agony, fell<br>down and died. The mighty king of the Vangas, however, quickly jumping<br>down from that elephant, alighted on the ground. Duryodhana then<br>beholding the prince of elephants slain, and seeing also his troops<br>broken and giving way, was filled with anguish. From regard, however, for<br>a Kshatriya's duty<span class="footnote-tooltip" style="color:rgb(255,193,7);"><sup><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i></sup><span class="footnote-tooltip-text">The duty consisted in not retreating from the field.  </span></span> as also his own pride, the king, though defeated,<br>stood firm like a hill. Filled with wrath and aiming a sharp arrow that<br>resembled the Yuga fire in energy, he sped it at that fierce wanderer of<br>the night. Beholding that arrow, blazing as Indra's bolt, thus coursing<br>towards him, the high-souled Ghatotkacha baffled it by the celerity of<br>his movements. With eyes red in wrath, he once more shouted fiercely,<br>frightening all thy troops, like the clouds that appear at the end of the<br>Yuga. Hearing those fierce roars of the terrible Rakshasa, Bhishma the<br>son of Santanu, approaching the preceptor, said these words, 'These<br>fierce roars that are heard, uttered by Rakshasas, without doubt indicate<br>that Hidimva's son is battling with king Duryodhana. That Rakshasa is<br>incapable of being vanquished in battle by any creature. Therefore,<br>blessed be ye, go thither and protect the king. The blessed Duryodhana<br>hath been attacked by the high-souled Rakshasa. Therefore, ye chastisers<br>of foes, even this is our highest duty.<span class="footnote-tooltip" style="color:rgb(255,193,7);"><sup><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i></sup><span class="footnote-tooltip-text">i.e., the rescue of the king.  </span></span>' Hearing those words of the<br>grandsire, those mighty car-warriors without loss of time and with the<br>utmost speed, proceeded to the spot when the king of the Kurus was. They<br>met Duryodhana and Somadatta and Valhika and Jayadratha; and Kripa and<br>Bhurisravas and Salya, and the two princes of Avanti along with<br>Vrihadvala, and Aswatthaman and Vikarna, and Chitrasena and Vivinsati.<br>And many thousands of other car-warriors, including all those that<br>followed them, proceeded, desirous of rescuing thy son Duryodhana who had<br>been hotly pressed. Beholding that invincible division protected by those<br>mighty car-warriors, coming towards him with hostile intentions, that<br>best of Rakshasas, viz., the mighty-armed Ghatotkacha, stood firm like<br>the Mainaka mountain, with a huge bow in hand, and surrounded by his<br>kinsmen armed with clubs and mallets and diverse other kinds of weapons.<br>Then commenced a fierce battle, making the hair stand on end, between<br>those Rakshasas on the one side and that foremost of Duryodhana's<br>divisions on the other. And the loud noise of twanging bows in that<br>battle was heard, O king, on all sides resembling the noise made by<br>burning bamboos. And the din produced by the weapons falling upon the<br>coats of mail of the combatants resembled, O king, the noise of splitting<br>hills. And the lances, O monarch, hurled by heroic arms, while coursing<br>through the welkin, looked like darting snakes. Then, excited with great<br>wrath and drawing his gigantic bow, the mighty-armed prince of the<br>Rakshasas, uttering a loud roar, cut off, with a crescent-shaped arrow,<br>the preceptor's bow in a rage. And overthrowing, with another<br>broad-headed arrow, the standard of Somadatta, he uttered a loud yell.<br>And he pierced Valhika with three shafts in the centre of the chest. And<br>he pierced Kripa with one arrow, and Chitrasena with three. And with<br>another arrow, well-armed and well-sped from his bow drawn to its fullest<br>stretch, he struck Vikarna at the shoulder-joint. Thereupon the latter,<br>covered with gore, sat down on the terrace of his car. Then that Rakshasa<br>of immeasurable soul, excited With rage, O bull of Bharata's race, sped<br>at Bhurisravas five and ten shafts. These, penetrating through the<br>latter's armour, entered the earth. He then struck the chariot of<br>Vivingsati and Aswatthaman. These fell down on the front of their cars,<br>relinquishing the reins of the steeds. With another crescent-shaped shaft<br>he overthrew the standard of Jayadratha bearing the device of a boar and<br>decked with gold. And with a second arrow he cut off the latter's bow.<br>And with eyes red in wrath, he slew with four shafts the four steeds of<br>the high-souled king of Avanti. And with another arrow, O king,<br>well-tempered and sharp, and shot from his bow drawn to its fullest<br>stretch, he pierced king Vrihadvala. Deeply pierced and exceedingly<br>pained, the latter sat down on the terrace of his car. Filled with great<br>wrath and seated on his car, the prince of the Rakshasas then shot many<br>bright arrows of keen points that resembled snakes of virulent poison.<br>These, O king, succeeded in piercing Salya accomplished in battle."
