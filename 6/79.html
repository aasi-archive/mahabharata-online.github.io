                    Sanjaya said, "Then Abhimanyu, accompanied by Bhimasena pursuing thy<br>sons, afflicted them all. Then the mighty car-warriors of thy army,<br>including Duryodhana and others, beholding Abhimanyu and Bhimasena united<br>with Prishata's son in the midst of the (Kauravas) troops, took up their<br>bows, and borne by their fleet steeds rushed to the spot where those<br>warriors were. And on that afternoon, O king, a dreadful conflict took<br>place between the mighty combatants of thy army and those of the foe, O<br>Bharata. And Abhimanyu, having, in that fierce battle, slain the steeds<br>of Vikarna, pierced the latter with five and twenty small arrows. Then<br>that mighty car-warrior, Vikarna, abandoning that car whose steeds had<br>been slain, mounted on the resplendent car, O king, of Chitrasena. Then<br>thus stationed on the same car, viz., those two brothers of Kuru's race,<br>the son of Arjuna covered, O Bharata, with showers of arrows. Then<br>Durjaya and Vikarna pierced Abhimanyu with five shafts made wholly of<br>iron. Abhimanyu however, shook not in the least but stood firm like the<br>mountain Meru. Dussasana in that battle, O sire, fought with the five<br>Kekaya brothers. All these, O great king, seemed exceedingly wonderful.<br>The sons of Draupadi, excited with rage, resisted Duryodhana in that<br>battle. And each of them, O king, pierced thy son with three shafts. Thy<br>son also, invincible in battle, pierced each of the sons of Draupadi, O<br>monarch, with sharp shafts. And pierced by them (in return) and bathed in<br>blood, he shone like a hill with rillets of water mixed with red-chalk<br>(gliding down its breast). And the mighty Bhishma also, in that battle, O<br>king, afflicted the Pandava army like a herdsman belabouring his herd.<br>Then, O monarch, the twang of Gandiva was heard, of Partha, who was<br>engaged in slaughtering the foe on the right of the army.<br><br>And in that part of the field headless trunks stood up by thousands,<br>amongst the troops, O Bharata, of both the Kauravas and the Pandavas. And<br>the field of battle resembled an ocean whose water was blood, and whose<br>eddies were the shafts (shot by the combatants). And the elephants<br>constituted the islands of that ocean, and the steeds its waves. And cars<br>constituted the boats by which brave men crossed it. And many brave<br>combatants, with arms cut off, divested of armour, and hideously<br>mutilated, were seen lying there in hundreds and thousands. And with the<br>bodies of infuriate elephants deprived of life and bathed in blood, the<br>field of battle. O Bharata, looked as if strewn with hills. And the<br>wonderful sight we saw there, O Bharata, was that neither in their army<br>nor in thine was a single person that was unwilling to fight. And thus, O<br>monarch, did those brave warriors, of both thy army and the Pandavas,<br>fight, seeking glory and desirous of victory."
