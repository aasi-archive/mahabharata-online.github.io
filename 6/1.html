                    (Jamvu-khanda Nirmana Parva)<br><br>OM! HAVING BOWED down to Narayana, and Nara, the most exalted of male<br>beings, and also to the goddess Saraswati, must the word 'Jaya' be<br>uttered.<br><br>Janamejaya said,&#8212;"How did those heroes, the Kurus, the Pandavas, and the<br>Somakas, and the high-souled kings assembled together from various<br>countries, fight?"<br><br>Vaisampayana said,&#8212;"Listen thou, O lord of the earth, how those<br>heroes,&#8212;the Kurus, the Pandavas, and the Somakas,&#8212;fought on the sacred<br>plain of the Kurukshetra.<span class="footnote-tooltip" style="color:rgb(255,193,7);"><sup><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i></sup><span class="footnote-tooltip-text">Tapas-kshetra because Kuru, the common ancestor of the rival houses, performed his ascetic austerities there. Since Kuru's time, many ascetics took up their abode there.  </span></span> Entering Kurukshetra, the Pandavas endued<br>with great might, along with the Somakas, advanced, desirous of victory,<br>against the Kauravas. Accomplished in the study of the Vedas, all (of<br>them) took great delight in battle. Expectant of success in battle, with<br>their troops (they) faced the fight. Approaching the army of<br>Dhritarashtra's son, those (warriors) invincible in battle<span class="footnote-tooltip" style="color:rgb(255,193,7);"><sup><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i></sup><span class="footnote-tooltip-text">Some texts have Duddharsham for Durddharshas.  </span></span> stationed<br>themselves with their troops on the western part (of the plain), their<br>faces turned towards the east. Yudhishthira, the son of Kunti, caused<br>tents by thousands to be set up according to rule, beyond the region<br>called Samantapanchaka. The whole earth seemed then to be empty, divested<br>of horses and men, destitute of cars and elephants, and with only the<br>children and the old left (at home). From the whole area of Jamvudwipa<br>over which the sun sheds his rays,<span class="footnote-tooltip" style="color:rgb(255,193,7);"><sup><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i></sup><span class="footnote-tooltip-text">Literally, "gives heat".  </span></span> was collected that force, O best of<br>kings. Men of all races,<span class="footnote-tooltip" style="color:rgb(255,193,7);"><sup><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i></sup><span class="footnote-tooltip-text">'Varna' is used here in the sense of races and not castes.  </span></span> assembled together, occupied an area<br>extending for many Yojanas over districts, rivers, hills, and woods. That<br>bull among men, king Yudhishthira, ordered excellent food and other<br>articles of enjoyment for all of them along with their animals. And<br>Yudhishthira fixed diverse watch-words for them; so that one saying this<br>should be known as belonging to the Pandavas. And that descendant of<br>Kuru's race also settled names and badges for all of them for recognition<br>during time of battle.<br><br>"Beholding the standard-top of Pritha's son, the high-souled son of<br>Dhritarashtra, with a white umbrella held over his head, in the midst of<br>a thousand elephants, and surrounded by his century of brothers, began<br>with all the kings (on his side) to array his troops against the son of<br>Pandu. Seeing Duryodhana, the Panchalas who took delight in battle, were<br>filled with joy and blew their loud-sounding conches and cymbals of sweet<br>sounds. Beholding those troops so delighted, Pandu's son and Vasudeva of<br>great energy had their hearts filled with joy. And those tigers among<br>men, Vasudeva and Dhananjaya, seated on one car, having felt great joy,<br>both blew their celestial conches. And hearing the blare of Gigantea and<br>the loud blast of Theodotes belonging unto the two, the combatants<br>ejected urine and excreta. As other animals are filled with fear on<br>hearing the voice of the roaring lion, even so became that force upon<br>hearing those blasts. A frightful dust arose and nothing could be seen,<br>for the sun himself, suddenly enveloped by it, seemed to have set.<span class="footnote-tooltip" style="color:rgb(255,193,7);"><sup><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i></sup><span class="footnote-tooltip-text">This sloka is variously read. For bhauman in the first line some texts read bhimam which I have adopted. For sahasa in the second line some texts have rajasa, and then aditye (locative) for 'adityas'.  </span></span> A<br>black cloud poured a shower of flesh and blood over the troops all<br>around. All this seemed extraordinary. A wind rose there, bearing along<br>the earth myriads of stony nodules, and afflicting therewith the<br>combatants by hundreds and thousands. (For all that), O monarch, both<br>armies, filled with joy, stood addrest for battle, on Kurukshetra like<br>two agitated oceans. Indeed, that encounter of the two armies was highly<br>wonderful, like that of two oceans when the end of the Yuga is arrived.<br>The whole earth was empty, having only the children and the old left (at<br>home), in consequence of that large army mustered by the Kauravas.<span class="footnote-tooltip" style="color:rgb(255,193,7);"><sup><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i></sup><span class="footnote-tooltip-text">The Bombay text is evidently faulty here; it repeats the second half of the 7th sloka, making the second half of the 25th the first half of the 24th.  </span></span><br>Then the Kurus, the Pandavas, and the Somakas made certain covenants, and<br>settled the rules, O bull of Bharata's race, regarding the different<br>kinds of combat. Persons equally circumstanced must encounter each other,<br>fighting fairly. And if having fought fairly the combatants withdraw<br>(without fear of molestation), even that would be gratifying to us. Those<br>who engaged in contests of words should be fought against with words.<br>Those that left the ranks should never be slain.<span class="footnote-tooltip" style="color:rgb(255,193,7);"><sup><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i></sup><span class="footnote-tooltip-text">i.e., stragglers should not be slain.  </span></span> A car-warrior should<br>have a car-warrior for his antagonist; he on the neck of an elephant<br>should have a similar combatant for his foe; a horse should be met by a<br>horse, and a foot-soldier, O Bharata; should be met by a foot-soldier.<br>Guided by considerations of fitness, willingness, daring and might, one<br>should strike another, giving notice. No one should strike another that<br>is unprepared<span class="footnote-tooltip" style="color:rgb(255,193,7);"><sup><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i></sup><span class="footnote-tooltip-text">Literally, "confiding."  </span></span> or panic-struck. One engaged with another, one seeking<br>quarter, one retreating, one whose weapon is rendered unfit, uncased in<br>mail, should never be struck. Car-drivers, animals (yoked to cars or<br>carrying weapons) men engaged in the transport of weapons,<span class="footnote-tooltip" style="color:rgb(255,193,7);"><sup><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i></sup><span class="footnote-tooltip-text">The Bombay text has Castropanayishu; the Bengal texts have Castropojibishu.  </span></span> players on<br>drums and blowers of conches should never be struck. Having made these<br>covenants, the Kurus, and the Pandavas, and the Somakas wondered much,<br>gazing at each other. And having stationed (their forces thus), those<br>bulls among men, those high-souled ones, with their troops, became glad<br>at heart, their joy being reflected on their countenances."
