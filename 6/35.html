                            [(Bhagavad Gita Chapter XI)]<br><br>"Arjuna said,&#8212;'This discourse about the supreme mystery, called<br>Adhyatman, which thou hast uttered for my welfare, hath dispelled my<br>delusion.<span class="footnote-tooltip" style="color:rgb(255,193,7);"><sup><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i></sup><span class="footnote-tooltip-text">Adhyatman, i.e., the relation between the Supreme and the individual soul. This my delusion, i.e., about my being the slayer.  </span></span> For I have heard at large from thee of the creation and<br>dissolution of beings, O thou of eyes like lotus petals, and also of thy<br>greatness that knoweth no deterioration. What thou hast said about<br>thyself, O great Lord, is even so. O best of Male Beings, I desire to<br>behold thy sovereign form. If, O Lord, thou thinkest that I am competent<br>to behold that (form), then, O Lord of mystic power, show me thy eternal<br>Self.<span class="footnote-tooltip" style="color:rgb(255,193,7);"><sup><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i></sup><span class="footnote-tooltip-text">Avyayam is that which has no decay. Ordinarily, it may be rendered "eternal." Telang renders it "inexhaustible". Elsewhere I have rendered it as "understanding."  </span></span>'<br><br>"The Holy One said, 'Behold, O son of Pritha, my forms by hundreds and<br>thousands, various, divine, diverse in hue and shape. Behold the Adityas,<br>the Vasus, the Rudras, the Aswins, and the Maruts. Behold, O Bharata,<br>innumerable marvels unseen before (by thee). Behold, O thou of curly<br>hair, the entire universe of mobiles and immobiles, collected together in<br>this body of mine, whatever else thou mayst wish to see.<span class="footnote-tooltip" style="color:rgb(255,193,7);"><sup><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i></sup><span class="footnote-tooltip-text">Ekastham, lit. "all in one". i.e., collected together.  </span></span> Thou art,<br>however, not competent to behold me with this eye of thine. I give thee<br>celestial sight. Behold my sovereign mystic nature.'"<br><br>Sanjaya continued,&#8212;"Having said this, O monarch, Hari, the mighty Lord<br>of mystic power, then revealed to the son of Pritha his Supreme sovereign<br>form, with many mouths and eyes, many wonderous aspects, many celestial<br>ornaments, many celestial weapons uplifted, wearing celestial garlands<br>and robes, (and) with unguents of celestial fragrance, full of every<br>wonder, resplendent, infinite, with faces turned on all sides.<span class="footnote-tooltip" style="color:rgb(255,193,7);"><sup><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i></sup><span class="footnote-tooltip-text">Devam is explained by Sreedhara as Dyotanatmakam i.e., endued with splendour. Mr. Davies renders it resplendent; but Telang renders it "deity."  </span></span> If<br>the splendour of a thousand suns were to burst forth at once in the sky,<br>(then) that would be like the splendour of that Mighty One. The son of<br>Pandu then beheld there in the body of that God of gods the entire<br>universe divided and sub-divided into many parts, all collected<br>together.<span class="footnote-tooltip" style="color:rgb(255,193,7);"><sup><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i></sup><span class="footnote-tooltip-text">Pra-vibhaktam-anekadha (divided diversely) is an adjective of Jagat. See Sreedhara. Both Mr. Davies and Telang seem to take it as a predicate in contra-distinction to Ekastham. This is scarcely correct.  </span></span> Then Dhananjaya, filled with amazement, (and) with hair<br>standing on end, bowing with (his) head, with joined hands addressed the<br>God.<br><br>"Arjuna said, 'I behold all the gods, O God, as also all the varied hosts<br>of creatures, (and) Brahman seated on (his) lotus seat, and all the<br>Rishis and the celestial snakes. I behold Thee with innumerable arms,<br>stomachs, mouths, (and) eyes, on every side, O thou of infinite forms.<br>Neither end nor middle, nor also beginning of thine do I behold, O Lord<br>of the universe, O thou of universal form. Bearing (thy) diadem, mace,<br>and discus, a mass of energy, glowing on all sides, do I behold thee that<br>art hard to look at, endued on all sides with the effulgence of the<br>blazing fire or the Sun, (and) immeasurable. Thou art indestructible,<br>(and) the Supreme object of this universe. Thou art without decay, the<br>guardian of eternal virtue. I regard thee to be the eternal (male) Being.<br>I behold thee to be without beginning, mean, end, to be of infinite<br>prowess, of innumerable arms, having the Sun and the Moon for thy eyes,<br>the blazing fire for thy mouth, and heating this universe with energy of<br>thy own. For the space betwixt heaven and earth is pervaded by Thee<br>alone, as also all the points of the horizon. At sight of this marvellous<br>and fierce form of thine, O Supreme Soul, the triple world trembleth. For<br>these hosts of gods are entering thee. Some, afraid, are praying with<br>joined hands. Saying Hail to Thee&#8212;the hosts of great Rishis and Siddhas<br>praise Thee with copious hymns of praise.<span class="footnote-tooltip" style="color:rgb(255,193,7);"><sup><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i></sup><span class="footnote-tooltip-text">Verse 21 is read differently. For Twam Surasangha, some texts read twa-Asurasanghas. Then again for Stuvanti in the second line some read Vikshate.  </span></span> The Rudras, the Adityas,<br>the Vasus, they that (called) the Siddhas, the Viswas, the Aswins, the<br>Maruts, also the Ushmapas, the Gandharvas, the Yakshas, the Asuras, the<br>hosts of Siddhyas, behold Thee and are all amazed. Beholding Thy mighty<br>form with many mouths and eyes, O mighty-armed one, with innumerable<br>arms, thighs and feet, many stomachs, (and) terrible in consequence of<br>many tusks, all creatures are frightened and I also. Indeed, touching the<br>very skies, of blazing radiance, many-hued, mouth wide-open, with eyes<br>that are blazing and large, beholding thee, O Vishnu, with (my) inner<br>soul trembling (in fright), I can no longer command courage and peace of<br>mind. Beholding thy mouths that are terrible in consequence of (their)<br>tusks, and that are fierce (as the all-destroying fire at the end of the<br>Yuga), I cannot recognise the points of the horizon nor can I command<br>peace of mind. Be gracious, O God of gods, O thou that art the refuge of<br>the Universe. And all these sons of Dhritarashtra, together with the<br>hosts of kings, and Bhishma, and Drona, and also this Suta's son (Karna),<br>accompanied by even the principal warriors of our side, are quickly<br>entering thy terrible mouths rendered fierce by thy tusks. Some, with<br>their heads crushed, are seen striking at the interstices of (thy) teeth.<br>As many currents of water flowing through different channels roll rapidly<br>towards the ocean, so these heroes of the world of men enter thy mouths<br>that flame all around. As moths with increasing speed rush for (their<br>own) destruction to the blazing fire, so also do (these) people, with<br>unceasing speed, enter thy mouths for (their) destruction. Swallowing all<br>these men from every side, thou lickest them with thy flaming mouths.<br>Filling the whole universe with (thy) energy, thy fierce splendours, O<br>Vishnu, are heating (everything). Tell me who thou art of (such) fierce<br>form. I bow to thee, O chief of the gods, be gracious to me. I desire to<br>know thee that art the Primeval One, I do not understand thy action.'<span class="footnote-tooltip" style="color:rgb(255,193,7);"><sup><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i></sup><span class="footnote-tooltip-text">Pravritti is explained by both Sankara and Sreedhara as Chesta, i.e., movements or acts. Mr. Davies is, I think, not correct in taking it to mean "evolved or developed form."  </span></span><br><br>The Holy One said, "I am Death, the destroyer of the worlds, fully<br>developed. I am now engaged in slaying the race of men. Without thee all<br>these warriors standing in the different divisions shall cease to<br>be.<span class="footnote-tooltip" style="color:rgb(255,193,7);"><sup><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i></sup><span class="footnote-tooltip-text">Kala here is death. Mr. Davies renders it Time, following some other translators. Pravriddha is not (as Mr. Davies renders it) "old" or "very old," but swelling or fully developed. Then again, Mr. Davies commits a ludicrous blunder in rendering Rite twam as "Except thee." This is one of those idioms at which a foreigner is sure to stumble who has only the lexicons for his guide. What Krishna says is not that all would perish save Arjuna, but that without Arjuna (i.e., even if he did not fight) all would perish.  </span></span> Wherefore, arise, gain glory, (and) vanquishing the foe, enjoy<br>(this) swelling kingdom. By me have all these been already slain. Be only<br>(my) instrument. O thou that can'st draw the bow with (even) the left<br>hand. Drona and Bhishma, and Jayadratha, and Karna, and also other heroic<br>warriors, (already) slain by me, do thou slay. Be not dismayed, fight;<br>thou shalt conquer in battle (thy) foes."<br><br>Sanjaya continued,&#8212;"Hearing these words of Kesava, the diadem-decked<br>(Arjuna), trembling, (and) with joined-hands, bowed (unto him); and once<br>more said unto Krishna, with voice choked up and overwhelmed with fear,<br>and making his salutations (to him).&#8212;<br><br>Arjuna said, "It is meet, Hrishikesa, that the universe is delighted and<br>charmed in uttering thy praise, and the Rakshasas flee in fear in all<br>directions, and the hosts of the Siddhas bow down (to thee). And why<br>should they not bow down to thee, O Supreme Soul, that are greater than<br>even Brahman (himself), and the primal cause? O thou that art Infinite. O<br>God of the gods, O thou that art the refuge of the universe, thou art<br>indestructible, thou art that which is, and that which is not and that<br>which is beyond (both). Thou art the First God, the ancient (male) Being,<br>thou art the Supreme refuge of this universe. Thou art the Knower, thou<br>art the Object to be known, thou art the highest abode. By thee is<br>pervaded this universe, O thou of infinite form.<span class="footnote-tooltip" style="color:rgb(255,193,7);"><sup><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i></sup><span class="footnote-tooltip-text">Nidhanam is either refuge or support or abode or receptacle. Mr. Davies incorrectly renders it "treasure-house."  </span></span> Thou art Vayu,<br>Yama, Agni, Varuna, Moon, Prajapati, and Grandsire. Obeisance be to thee<br>a thousand times, and again and yet again obeisance to thee. Obeisance to<br>thee in front, and also from behind. Let obeisance be to thee from every<br>side, O thou that art all. Thou art all, of energy that is infinite, and<br>prowess that is immeasurable. Thou embracest the All. Regarding (thee) a<br>friend whatever hath been said by me carelessly, such as&#8212;O Krishna, O<br>Yadava, O friend,&#8212;not knowing this thy greatness from want of judgement<br>or from love either, whatever disrespect hath been shown thee for purpose<br>of mirth, on occasions of play, lying, sitting, (or) at meals, while<br>alone or in the presence of others, O undeteriorating one, I beg thy<br>pardon for it, that art immeasurable. Thou art the father of this<br>universe of mobiles and immobiles. Thou art the great master deserving of<br>worship. There is none equal to thee, how can there be one greater? O<br>thou whose power is unparalleled in even three worlds?<span class="footnote-tooltip" style="color:rgb(255,193,7);"><sup><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i></sup><span class="footnote-tooltip-text">Sankara accepts the reading Gururgariyan, Sreedhara takes it as Gururgariyan. In either case the difference in meaning is not material.  </span></span> Therefore<br>bowing (to thee) prostrating (my) body, I ask thy grace, O Lord, O<br>adorable one. It behoveth thee. O God, to bear (my faults) as a father<br>(his) son's, a friend (his) friend's, a lover (his) loved one's.<br>Beholding (thy) form (unseen) before, I have been joyful, (yet) my mind<br>hath been troubled, with fear. Show me that (other ordinary) form, O God.<br>Be gracious, O Lord of the gods, O thou that art the refuge of the<br>universe. (Decked) in diadem, and (armed) with mace, discus in hand, as<br>before, I desire to behold thee. Be of that same four-armed form, O thou<br>of a thousand arms, thou of universal form."<br><br>"The Holy One said, 'Pleased with thee, O Arjuna, I have, by my (own)<br>mystic power, shown thee this supreme form, full of glory, Universal,<br>Infinite, Primeval, which hath been seen before by none save thee. Except<br>by thee alone, hero of Kuru's race, I cannot be seen in this form in the<br>world of men by any one else, (aided) even by the study of the Vedas and<br>of sacrifices, by gifts, by actions, (or) by the severest<br>austerities.<span class="footnote-tooltip" style="color:rgb(255,193,7);"><sup><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i></sup><span class="footnote-tooltip-text">Sankara connects Adhyayana with Veda and Yajna. This seems to be right explanation.  </span></span> Let no fear be thine, nor perplexity of mind at seeing<br>this awful form of mine. Freed from fear with a joyful heart, thou again<br>see Me assuming that other form.'"<br><br>Sanjaya continued,&#8212;"Vasudeva, having said all this to Arjuna, once more<br>showed (him) his own (ordinary) form, and that High-Souled one, assuming<br>once more (his) gentle form, comforted him who had been afflicted."<br><br>"Arjuna said, 'Beholding this gentle human form of thine, O Janardana, I<br>have now become of right mind and have come to my normal state.'<br><br>"The Holy One said, 'This form of mine which thou hast seen is difficult<br>of being seen. Even the gods are always desirous of becoming spectators<br>of this (my) form. Not by the Vedas, nor by austerities, nor by gifts,<br>nor by sacrifices, can I be seen in this form of mine which thou hast<br>seen. By reverence, however, that is exclusive (in its objects), O<br>Arjuna, I can in this form be known, seen truly, and attained to, O<br>chastiser of foes. He who doth everything for me, who hath me for his<br>supreme object, who is freed from attachment, who is without enmity<br>towards all beings, even he, O Arjuna, cometh to me.'
