                    Dhritarashtra said,&#8212;"Beholding our ten and one Akshauhinis arrayed in<br>order of battle, how did Yudhishthira, the son of Pandu, make his<br>counter-array with his forces smaller in number? How did Kunti's son, O<br>Sanjaya, form his counter-array against that Bhishma who was acquainted<br>with all kinds of arrays, viz., human, celestial, Gandharva, and Asura?"<br><br>Sanjaya said,&#8212;"Seeing the Dhritarashtra divisions arrayed in order of<br>battle, Pandu's son of virtuous soul, king Yudhishthira the just,<br>addressed Dhananjaya, saying,&#8212;'Men are informed from the words of that<br>great Rishi Vrihaspati that the few must be made to fight by condensing<br>them, while the many may be extended according to pleasure. In encounters<br>of the few with the many, the array to be formed should be the<br>needle-mouthed one. Our troops compared with the enemy's are few. Keeping<br>in view this precept of the great Rishi, array our troops, O son of<br>Pandu.' Hearing this, that son of Pandu answered king Yudhishthira the<br>just, saying,&#8212;That immovable array known by the name of Vajra, which was<br>designed by the wielder of the thunder-bolt,&#8212;that invincible array is<br>the one that I will make for thee, O best of kings. He who is like the<br>bursting tempest, he who is incapable of being borne in battle by the<br>foe, that Bhima the foremost of smiters, will fight at our head. That<br>foremost of men, conversant with all the appliances of battle, becoming<br>our leader, will fight in the van, crushing the energy of the foe. That<br>foremost of smiters, viz., Bhima, beholding whom all the hostile warriors<br>headed by Duryodhana will retreat in panic like smaller animals beholding<br>the lion, all of us, our fears dispelled, will seek his shelter as if he<br>were a wall, like the celestial seeking the shelter of Indra. The man<br>breathes not in the world who would bear to cast his eyes upon that bull<br>among men, Vrikodara of fierce deeds, when he is angry.'&#8212;Having said<br>this, Dhananjaya of mighty arms did as he said. And Phalguni, quickly<br>disposing his troops in battle-array, proceeded (against the foe). And<br>the mighty army of the Pandavas beholding the Kuru army move, looked like<br>the full, immovable, and quickly rolling<span class="footnote-tooltip" style="color:rgb(255,193,7);"><sup><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i></sup><span class="footnote-tooltip-text">The Bengal texts read Syandamana; the Bombay reading is Spandamana.

And<br>Bhimasena, and Dhrishtadyumna endued with great energy, and Nakula, and<br>Sahadeva, and king Dhrishtaketu, became the leaders of that force. And<br>king Virata, surrounded by an Akshawhini of troops and accompanied by his<br>brothers and sons, marched in their rear, protecting them from behind.<br>The two sons of Madri, both endued with great effulgence, became the<br>protectors of Bhima's wheels; while the (five) sons of Draupadi and the<br>son of Subhadra all endued with great activity, protected (Bhima) from<br>behind. And that mighty car-warrior, Dhrishtadyumna, the prince of<br>Panchala, with those bravest of combatants and the foremost of<br>car-warriors, viz., the Prabhadrakas, protected those princes from<br>behind. And behind him was Sikhandin who (in his turn) was protected by<br>Arjuna, and who, O bull of Bharata's race, advanced with concentrated<br>attention for the destruction of Bhishma. Behind Arjuna was Yuyudhana of<br>mighty strength; and the two princes of Panchala, viz., Yudhamanyu and<br>Uttamaujas, became protectors of Arjuna's wheels, along with the Kekaya<br>brothers, and Dhrishtaketu, and Chekitana of great valour&#8212;This<br>Bhimasena, wielding his mace made of the hardest metal, and moving (on<br>the field of battle) with fierce speed, can dry up the very ocean.

Darsay swamahavalam is scarcely correct. The Bengal reading is 'Darsayan sumahavalam.'  </span></span> And while<br>Partha was saying so, all the troops, O Bharata, worshipped him on the<br>field of battle with gratulatory words. King Yudhishthira, the son of<br>Kunti, took up his position in the centre of his army, surrounded by huge<br>and furious elephants resembling moving hills. The high-souled Yajnasena,<br>the king of the Panchalas, endued with great prowess, stationed himself<br>behind Virata with an Akshauhini of troops for the sake of the Pandavas.<br>And on the cars of those kings, O monarch, were tall standards bearing<br>diverse devices, decked with excellent ornaments of gold, and endued with<br>the effulgence of the Sun and the Moon. Causing those kings to move and<br>make space for him, that mighty car-warrior Dhrishtadyumna, accompanied<br>by his brothers and sons protected Yudhishthira from behind. Transcending<br>the huge standards on all the cars on thy side and that of the enemy, was<br>the one gigantic ape on Arjuna's car. Foot-soldiers, by many hundreds of<br>thousands, and armed with swords, spears, and scimitars, proceeded ahead<br>for protecting Bhimasena. And ten thousand elephants with (temporal)<br>juice trickling down their cheek and mouth, and resembling (on that<br>account) showering clouds,<span class="footnote-tooltip" style="color:rgb(255,193,7);"><sup><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i></sup><span class="footnote-tooltip-text">Literally, "with rent cheeks and mouth."  </span></span> endued with great courage, blazing with<br>golden armour, huge hills, costly, and emitting the fragrance of lotuses,<br>followed the king behind like moving mountains.<span class="footnote-tooltip" style="color:rgb(255,193,7);"><sup><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i></sup><span class="footnote-tooltip-text">The Bombay reading is certainly faulty here.

Incapable of<br>being looked at like the Sun himself, and scorching as it were, the<br>hostile army (like fire), none of the combatants could bear to even look<br>at him from any neat point.

And protected by the Pandavas, that array<br>became invincible in the world of men.<br><br>"'And as (both) the armies stood at dawn of day waiting for sunrise, a<br>wind began to blow with drops of water (falling), and although there were<br>no clouds, the roll of thunder was heard. And dry winds began to blow all<br>around, bearing a shower of pointed pebbles along the ground. And as<br>thick dust arose, covering the world with darkness. And large meteors<br>began to fall east-wards, O bull of Bharata's race, and striking against<br>the rising Sun, broke in fragments with loud noise. When the troops stood<br>arrayed, O bull of Bharata's race, the Sun rose divested of splendour,<br>and the Earth trembled with a loud sound, and cracked in many places, O<br>chief of the Bharatas, with loud noise. And the roll of thunder, O king,<br>was heard frequently on all sides. So thick was the dust that arose that<br>nothing could be seen. And the tall standards (of the combatants),<br>furnished with strings of bells, decked with golden ornaments, garlands<br>of flowers, and rich drapery, graced with banners and resembling the Sun<br>in splendour, being suddenly shaken by the wind, gave a loud jingling<br>noise like that of a forest of palmyra trees (when moved by the wind). It<br>was thus that those tigers among men, the sons of Pandu, ever taking<br>delight in battle, stood having disposed their troops in counter-array<br>against the army of thy son, and sucking as it were, the marrow, O bull<br>of Bharata's race, of our warriors, and casting their eyes on Bhimasena<br>stationed at their head, mace in hand."
