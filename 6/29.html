                    [(Bhagavad Gita Chapter V)]<br><br>"Arjuna said,&#8212;'Thou applaudest, O Krishna, the abandonment of actions,<br>and again the application (to them). Tell me definitely which one of<br>these two is superior.<br><br>"The Holy One said&#8212;'Both abandonment of actions and application to<br>actions lead to emancipation. But of these, application to action is<br>superior to abandonment. He should always be known to be an ascetic who<br>hath no aversion nor desire. For, being free from pairs of opposites, O<br>thou of mighty arms, he is easily released from the bonds (of action).<br>Fools say, but not those that are wise, that Sankhya and Yoga are<br>distinct. One who stayeth in even one (of the two) reapeth the fruit of<br>both<span class="footnote-tooltip" style="color:rgb(255,193,7);"><sup><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i></sup><span class="footnote-tooltip-text">Sankhya is renunciation of action, while Yoga is devotion through action.  </span></span>. Whatever seat is attained by those who profess the Sankhya<br>system, that too is reached by those who profess the Yoga. He seeth truly<br>who seeth Sankhya and Yoga as one.<span class="footnote-tooltip" style="color:rgb(255,193,7);"><sup><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i></sup><span class="footnote-tooltip-text">The grammatical form of the word Yoga as here employed is exceptional.  </span></span> But renunciation, O mighty-armed<br>one, without devotion (to action), is difficult to attain. The ascetic<br>who is engaged in devotion (by action) reacheth the Supreme Being without<br>delay. He who is engaged in devotion (by action) and is of pure soul, who<br>hath conquered his body and subdued his senses, and who indentifieth<br>himself with all creatures, is not fettered though performing<br>(action).<span class="footnote-tooltip" style="color:rgb(255,193,7);"><sup><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i></sup><span class="footnote-tooltip-text">The first atman is explained as the soul, the second as the body, by all the commentators.  </span></span> The man of devotion, who knoweth truth, thinking&#8212;I am<br>doing nothing&#8212;When seeing, hearing, touching, smelling, eating, moving,<br>sleeping, breathing, talking, excreting, taking, opening the eyelids or<br>closing them; he regardeth that it is the senses that are engaged in the<br>objects of senses.<span class="footnote-tooltip" style="color:rgb(255,193,7);"><sup><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i></sup><span class="footnote-tooltip-text">Taking means taking anything with the hands.  </span></span> He who renouncing attachment engageth in actions,<br>resigning them to Brahma, is not touched by sin as the lotus-leaf (is not<br>touched) by water.<span class="footnote-tooltip" style="color:rgb(255,193,7);"><sup><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i></sup><span class="footnote-tooltip-text">Water when thrown over a lotus-leaf escapes without soaking or drenching the leaf at all.  </span></span> Those who are devotees, casting off attachment,<br>perform actions (attaining) purity of self, with the body, the mind, the<br>understanding, and even the senses (free from desire). He who is<br>possessed of devotion, renouncing the fruit of action, attaineth to the<br>highest tranquillity. He, who is not possessed of devotion and is<br>attached to the fruit of action, is fettered by action performed from<br>desire. The self-restrained embodied (self), renouncing all actions by<br>the mind, remains at ease within the house of nine gates, neither acting<br>himself nor causing (anything) to act.<span class="footnote-tooltip" style="color:rgb(255,193,7);"><sup><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i></sup><span class="footnote-tooltip-text">Telang renders Pura as city, of course, the body having two eyes, two ears, two nostrils, one mouth, and two openings for excretions, is meant.  </span></span> The Lord is not the cause of<br>the capacity for action, or of the actions of men, or of the connection<br>of actions and (their) fruit. It is nature that engages (in action). The<br>Lord receiveth no one's sin, nor also merit. By ignorance, knowledge is<br>shrouded. It is for this that creatures are deluded. But of whomsoever<br>that ignorance hath been destroyed by knowledge of self, that knowledge<br>(which is) like the Sun discloseth the Supreme Being. Those whose mind is<br>on Him, whose very soul is He, who abide in Him, and who have Him for<br>their goal, depart never more to return, their sins being all destroyed<br>by knowledge.<span class="footnote-tooltip" style="color:rgb(255,193,7);"><sup><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i></sup><span class="footnote-tooltip-text">Such men are exempted from the obligation of re-birth. Leaving this body they merge into the Supreme Soul.  </span></span> Those, who are wise cast an equal eye on a Brahmana<br>endued with learning and modesty, on a cow, an elephant, a dog, and a<br>chandala.<span class="footnote-tooltip" style="color:rgb(255,193,7);"><sup><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i></sup><span class="footnote-tooltip-text">The word is Swapacha meaning a member of the lowest caste.  </span></span> Even here has birth been conquered by them whose minds<br>rest on equality; and since Brahma is faultless and equable, therefore,<br>they (are said to) abide in Brahma.<span class="footnote-tooltip" style="color:rgb(255,193,7);"><sup><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i></sup><span class="footnote-tooltip-text">"Brahma is faultless and equable"; so Sreedhara and others,--"since faultless equality is Brahma."  </span></span> He whose mind is steady, who is<br>not deluded, who knows Brahma, and who rests in Brahma, doth not exult on<br>obtaining anything that is agreeable, nor doth he grieve on obtaining<br>that is disagreeable. He whose mind is not attached to external objects<br>of sense, obtaineth that happiness which is in self; and by concentrating<br>his mind on the contemplation of Brahma, he enjoyeth a happiness that is<br>imperishable. The enjoyments born of the contact (of the senses with<br>their objects) are productive of sorrow. He who is wise, O son of Kunti,<br>never taketh pleasure in these that have a beginning and an end. That man<br>whoever here, before the dissolution of the body, is able to endure the<br>agitations resulting from desire and wrath, is fixed on contemplation,<br>and is happy. He who findeth happiness within himself, (and) who sporteth<br>within himself, he whose light (of knowledge) is deprived from within<br>himself, is a devotee, and becoming one with Brahma attaineth to<br>absorption into Brahma. Those saintly personages whose sins have been<br>destroyed, whose doubts have been dispelled, who are self-restrained, and<br>who are engaged in the good of all creatures, obtain absorption into<br>Brahma. For these devotees who are freed from desire and wrath, whose<br>minds are under control, and who have knowledge of self, absorption into<br>Brahma exists both here and thereafter.<span class="footnote-tooltip" style="color:rgb(255,193,7);"><sup><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i></sup><span class="footnote-tooltip-text">The sense is that they are at one with Brahma both here and hereafter.  </span></span> Excluding (from his mind)<br>all external objects of sense, directing the visual glance between the<br>brows, mingling (into one) the upward and the downward life-breaths and<br>making them pass through the nostrils, the devotee, who has restrained<br>the senses, the mind, and the understanding, being intent on<br>emancipation, and who is freed from desire, fear, and wrath, is<br>emancipated, indeed. Knowing me to be enjoyer of all sacrifices and<br>ascetic austerities, the great Lord of all the worlds, and friend of all<br>creatures, such a one obtaineth tranquillity.'
