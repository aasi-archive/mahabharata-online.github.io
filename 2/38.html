                    "Vaisampayana said,&#8212;The mighty Bhishma ceased, having said this.<br>Sahadeva then answered (Sisupala) in words of grave import, saying,&#8212;'If<br>amongst ye there be any king that cannot bear to see Kesava of dark hue,<br>the slayer of Kesi, the possessor of immeasurable energy, worshipped by<br>me, this my foot is placed on the heads of all mighty ones (like him).<br>When I say this, let that one give me an adequate reply. And let those<br>kings that possess intelligence approve the worship of Krishna who is the<br>preceptor, the father, the guru, and deserveth the Arghya and the worship<br>(already offered unto him).'<br><br>"When Sahadeva thus showed his foot, no one among those intelligent and<br>wise and proud and mighty monarchs said anything. And a shower of flowers<br>fell on Sahadeva's head, and an incorporeal voice said&#8212;'Excellent,<br>excellent.' Then Narada clad in black deer-skin, speaking of both the<br>future and the past, that dispeller of all doubts, fully acquainted with<br>all the worlds, said in the midst of innumerable creatures, these words<br>of the clearest import,&#8212;'Those men that will not worship the lotus-eyed<br>Krishna should be regarded as dead though moving, and should never be<br>talked to on any occasion.'"<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued,&#8212;Then that god among men, Sahadeva cognisant of<br>the distinction between a Brahmana and a Kshatriya, having worshipped<br>those that deserved worship, completed that ceremony. But upon Krishna<br>having received the first worship, Sunitha (Sisupala) that mower of<br>foes&#8212;with eyes red as copper from anger, addressed those rulers of men<br>and said,&#8212;'When I am here to head ye all, what are ye thinking of now?<br>Arrayed let us stand in battle against the assembled Vrishnis and the<br>Pandavas?' And the bull of the Chedis, having thus stirred the kings up,<br>began to consult with them how to obstruct the completion of the<br>sacrifice. All the invited monarchs who had come to the sacrifice, with<br>Sunitha as their chief, looked angry and their faces became pale. They<br>all said, 'We must so act that the final sacrificial rite performed by<br>Yudhishthira and the worship of Krishna may not be regarded as having<br>been acquiesced in by us. And impelled by a belief in their power and<br>great assurance, the kings, deprived of reason through anger, began to<br>say this. And being moved by self-confidence and smarting under the<br>insult offered unto them, the monarchs repeatedly exclaimed thus. Though<br>their friends sought to appease them, their faces glowed with anger like<br>those of roaring lions driven away from their preys. Krishna then<br>understood that the vast sea of monarchs with its countless waves of<br>troops was preparing for a terrific rush."
