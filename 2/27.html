                    Vaisampayana said,&#8212;"that heroic and foremost of the Pandavas endued with<br>great energy, crossing the White mountains, subjugated the country of the<br>Limpurushas ruled by Durmaputra, after a collision involving a great<br>slaughter of Kshatriyas, and brought the region under his complete sway.<br>Having reduced that country, the son of Indra (Arjuna) with a collected<br>mind marched at the head of his troops to the country called Harataka,<br>ruled by the Guhakas. Subjugating them by a policy of conciliation, the<br>Kuru prince beheld (in that region) that excellent of lakes called Manasa<br>and various other lakes and tanks sacred to the Rishis. And the exalted<br>prince having arrived at the lake Manasa conquered the regions ruled by<br>the Gandharvas that lay around the Harataka territories. Here the<br>conqueror took, as tribute from the country, numerous excellent horses<br>called Tittiri, Kalmasha, Manduka. At last the son of the slayer of Paka,<br>arriving in the country of North Harivarsha desired to conquer it.<br>Thereupon certain frontier-guards of huge bodies and endued with great<br>strength and energy, coming to him with gallant hearts, said, 'O son of<br>Pritha, this country can be never conquered by thee. If thou seekest thy<br>good, return hence. He that entereth this region, if human, is sure to<br>perish. We have been gratified with thee; O hero, thy conquests have been<br>enough. Nor is anything to be seen here, O Arjuna, that may be conquered<br>by thee. The Northern Kurus live here. There cannot be war here. Even if<br>thou enterest it, thou will not be able to behold anything, for with<br>human eyes nothing can be seen here. If, however thou seekest anything<br>else, O Bharata tell us, O tiger among men, so that we may do thy<br>bidding. Thus addressed by them, Arjuna smilingly addressing them,<br>said,&#8212;'I desire the acquisition of the imperial dignity by Yudhishthira<br>the just, of great intelligence. If your land is shut against human<br>beings, I shall not enter it. Let something be paid unto Yudhishthira by<br>ye as tribute. Hearing these words of Arjuna, they gave him as tribute<br>many cloths and ornaments of celestial make, silks of celestial texture<br>and skins of celestial origin.<br><br>"It was thus that tiger among men subjugated the countries that lay to<br>the North, having fought numberless battles with both Kshatriya and<br>robber tribes. And having vanquished the chiefs and brought them under<br>his sway he exacted from them much wealth, various gems and jewels, the<br>horses of the species called Tittiri and Kalmasha, as also those of the<br>colour of the parrot's wings and those that were like the peacocks in hue<br>and all endued with the speed of the wind. And surrounded, O king, by a<br>large army consisting of the four kinds of forces, the hero came back to<br>the excellent city of Sakraprastha. And Partha offered the whole of that<br>wealth, together with the animals he had brought, unto Yudhishthira the<br>just. And commanded by the monarch, the hero retired to a chamber of the<br>palace for rest."
