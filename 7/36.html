                    "Dhritarashtra said, 'While Arjuna's son was thus grinding, by means of<br>his straight arrows, our foremost bowmen, what warriors of my army<br>endeavoured to check him?'<br><br>"Sanjaya said, 'Hear, O king, of the splendid prowess in battle of<br>youthful Abhimanyu while engaged in breaking the car-ranks (of the<br>Kauravas), protected by the son of Bharadwaja himself.'<br><br>"Beholding the ruler of the Madras disabled in battle by Subhadra's son<br>with his shafts, the younger brother of Salya, filled with wrath,<br>advanced against Abhimanyu, scattering his shafts. Arjuna's son however.<br>endued with great lightness of hand, cut off his antagonist's head and<br>charioteer, his triple bamboo-pole, his bed (on the car), his car-wheels,<br>his yoke, and shafts and quiver, and car-bottom, by means of his arrows,<br>as also his banner and every other implements of battle with which his<br>car was equipped. So quick were his movements that none could obtain a<br>sight of his person. Deprived of life, that foremost and chief of all<br>ornaments of battle fell down on the earth, like a huge hill uprooted by<br>a mighty tempest. His followers then, struck with fear, fled away in all<br>directions. Beholding that feat of the son of Arjuna, all creatures were<br>highly gratified, and cheered him, O Bharata, with loud shouts of<br>'Excellent, Excellent!'<br><br>"After Salya's brother had thus been slain, many followers of his, loudly<br>proclaiming their families, places of residence, and names, rushed<br>against Arjuna's son, filled with rage and armed With diverse weapons.<br>Some of them were on cars, some on steeds and some on elephants; and<br>others advanced on foot. And all of them were endued with fierce might.<br>And they rushed frightening the son of Arjuna with the loud whiz of their<br>arrows, the deep roar of their car-wheels, their fierce whoops and shouts<br>and cries, their leonine roars, the loud twang of their bow-string, and<br>the slaps of their palms. And they said, 'Thou shalt not escape us with<br>life today!' Hearing them say so, the son of Subhadra, smiling the while,<br>pierced with his shafts those amongst them that had pierced him first.<br>Displaying diverse weapons of beautiful look and of great celerity, the<br>heroic son of Arjuna battled mildly with them. Those weapons that he had<br>received from Vasudeva and those that he had received from Dhananjaya,<br>Abhimanyu displayed in the very same way as Vasudeva and Dhananjaya.<br>Disregarding the heavy burthen he had taken upon himself and casting off<br>all fear, he repeatedly shot his arrows. No interval, again, could be<br>noticed between his aiming and letting off an arrow. Only his trembling<br>bow drawn to a circle could be seen on every side, looking like the<br>blazing disc of the autumnal sun. And the twang of his bow, and the slap<br>of his palms, O Bharata, were heard to resound like the roaring of clouds<br>charged with thunder. Modest, wrathful, reverential to superiors, and<br>exceedingly handsome, the son of Subhadra, out of regard for the hostile<br>heroes, fought with them mildly. Commencing gently, O king, he gradually<br>became fierce, like the illustrious maker of the day when autumn comes<br>after the season of the rains is over. Like the Sun himself shedding his<br>rays, Abhimanyu, filled with wrath, shot hundreds and thousands of<br>whetted arrows, furnished with golden wings. In the very sight of<br>Bharadwaja's son, that celebrated warrior covered the car-division of the<br>Kaurava army with diverse kinds of arrows.<span class="footnote-tooltip" style="color:rgb(255,193,7);"><sup><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i></sup><span class="footnote-tooltip-text">I omit the names as they occur in the text. These are: (1) Kshurupras, i.e., arrows sharp as razors, (2) Vatsadantas, i.e., arrows having heads like the calf-tooth, (3) Vipathas, i.e., long arrows having stout bodies, (4) Narachas, long arrows; Ardhachandrabhais, i.e., looking like shafts furnished with heads of the form of the half-moon; it is an adjective qualifying Narachis, (5) Anjalikas were broad-headed shafts.  </span></span> Thereupon, that army thus<br>afflicted by Abhimanyu with his shafts, turned its back on the field.'"
