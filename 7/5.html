                    "Sanjaya said, 'Beholding that tiger among men, viz., Karna, mounted on<br>his car, Duryodhana, O king, filled with joy, said these words, 'This<br>host, protected by thee, hath now, I think, got a proper leader. Let<br>that, however, be settled now which is proper and within our power.'<br><br>'Karna said, 'Tell us thyself, O tiger among men, for thou art the wisest<br>of kings. Another can never see so well what should be done as one seeth<br>it whose concern it is. Those kings are all desirous of listening to what<br>thou mayst have to say. I am sure that no improper words will be uttered<br>by thee.'<br><br>"Duryodhana, said, 'Bhishma was our commander possessed (as he was) of<br>years, prowess, and learning and supported by all our warriors. That<br>high-souled one, O Karna, achieving great glory and slaying large numbers<br>of my enemies protected us by fair fight for ten days. He achieved the<br>most difficult of feats. But now that he is about to ascend to heaven,<br>whom, O Karna, dost thou think fit to our commander after him? Without a<br>leader, an army cannot stay in battle for even a short while. Thou art<br>foremost in battle, like a boat without a helmsman in the waters. Indeed,<br>as a boat without a helmsman, or a car without a driver, would go<br>anywhere, so would the plight be of a host that is without a leader. Like<br>a merchant who falleth into every kind of distress when he is<br>unacquainted with the ways of the country he visits, an army that is<br>without a leader is exposed to every kind of distress. Look thou,<br>therefore, among all the high-souled warriors of our army and find out a<br>proper leader who may succeed the son of Santanu. Him whom thou wouldst<br>regard as a fit leader in battle, him, all of us, without doubt, will<br>together make our leader.'<br><br>"Karna said, 'All these foremost of men are high-souled persons. Every<br>one of them deserveth to be our leader. There is no need of any minute<br>examination. All of them are conversant with noble genealogies and with<br>the art of smiting; all of them are endued with prowess and intelligence,<br>all of them are attentive and acquainted with the scriptures, possessed<br>of wisdom, and unretreating from battle.<span class="footnote-tooltip" style="color:rgb(255,193,7);"><sup><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i></sup><span class="footnote-tooltip-text">Kula-samhanana-jnana, i.e., 'knowledge of Kula, as also of samhanana, which latter, as Nilakantha explains, means the body. A knowledge of the body, of vital and other limbs, was possessed by every accomplished warrior who wanted to smite effectually.  </span></span> All, however, cannot be<br>leaders at the same time. Only one should be selected as leader, in whom<br>are special merits. All of these regard one another as equals. If one<br>amongst them, therefore, be honoured, others will be dissatisfied, and,<br>it is evident, will no longer fight for thee from a desire of benefiting<br>thee. This one, however, is the Preceptor (in arms) of all these<br>warriors; is venerable in years, and worthy of respect. Therefore, Drona,<br>this foremost of all wielders of weapons, should be made the leader. Who<br>is there worthy of becoming a leader, when the invincible Drona, that<br>foremost of persons conversant with Brahma, is here, that one who is<br>equal to Sukra or Vrihaspati himself? Amongst all the kings in thy army,<br>O Bharata, there is not a single warrior who will not follow Drona when<br>the latter goeth to battle.<span class="footnote-tooltip" style="color:rgb(255,193,7);"><sup><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i></sup><span class="footnote-tooltip-text">i.e., who will feel it humiliating for him to walk behind Drona?  </span></span> This Drona is the foremost of all leaders<br>of forces, the foremost of all wielders of weapons, and the foremost of<br>all intelligent persons. He is, besides, O king, thy preceptor (in arms).<br>Therefore, O Duryodhana, make this one the leader of thy forces without<br>delay, as the celestials made Kartikeya their leader in battle for<br>vanquishing the Asuras.'"
