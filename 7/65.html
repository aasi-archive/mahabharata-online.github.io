                    "Narada said, 'King Sasavindu, O Srinjaya, we hear, fell a prey to death.<br>Of great beauty and of prowess incapable of being baffled, he performed<br>diverse sacrifices. That high-souled monarch had one hundred thousand<br>wives. From each of those wives were born a thousand sons. All those<br>princes were endued with great prowess. They performed millions of<br>sacrifices. Accomplished in the Vedas, those kings performed many<br>foremost of sacrifices. All of them were cased (on occasions of battle)<br>in golden coats of mail. And all of them were excellent bowmen. All these<br>princes born of Sasavindu performed Horse-sacrifices. Their father, O<br>best of monarchs, in the Horse-sacrifices he had performed, gave away,<br>(as sacrificial presents), all those sons unto the Brahmanas. Behind each<br>of those princes were hundreds upon hundreds of cars and elephants and<br>fair maidens decked in ornaments of gold. With each maiden were a hundred<br>elephants; with each elephant, a hundred cars; with each car a hundred<br>steeds, adorned with garlands of gold. With each of those steeds were a<br>thousand kine; and with each cow were fifty goats. The highly blessed<br>Sasavindu gave away unto the Brahmanas, in the great Horse-sacrifice of<br>his such unlimited wealth. The king caused as many sacrificial stakes of<br>gold to be made for that great Horse-sacrifice of his as is the number,<br>double of sacrificial stakes of wood in other sacrifices of the kind.<br>There were mountains of food and drink of the height of about two miles<br>each. Upon the completion of' his Horse-sacrifice, thirteen such<br>mountains of food and drink remained (untouched). His kingdom abounded in<br>people that were contented and well-fed. And it was free from all inroads<br>of evil and the people were perfectly happy. Having ruled for many long<br>years, Sasavindu, at last, ascended to heaven. When he died, O Srinjaya,<br>who was superior to thee in respect of the four cardinal virtues and who<br>superior to thee was, therefore, much more superior to thy son, thou<br>shouldst not, saying, 'Oh, Swaitya, Oh Swaitya', grieve for the latter<br>who performed no sacrifice and made no sacrificial present.'"
