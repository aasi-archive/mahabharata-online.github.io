                    "Sanjaya said, 'During the progress of that battle between Karna and the<br>Rakshasa, the valiant Alayudha, that prince of Rakshasa, appeared (on the<br>field). Accompanied by a large force, he approached Duryodhana. Indeed,<br>surrounded by many thousands of frightful Rakshasas of diverse forms and<br>endued with great heroism, he appeared (on the field) recollecting his<br>old quarrel (with the Pandavas). His kinsmen, that valiant Vaka, who ate<br>Brahmanas, as also Kirmira of great energy, and his friend Hidimva, had<br>been slain (by Bhima). He had waited for a long time, brooding over his<br>old quarrel. Learning now that a nocturnal battle was raging, he came,<br>impelled by the desire of slaying Bhima in fight, like an infuriated<br>elephant or an angry snake. Desirous of battle, he addressed Duryodhana<br>and said, 'It is known to thee, how my kinsmen, the Rakshasa Vaka and<br>Kirmira and Hidimva have been slain by Bhima. What shall I say more, the<br>virgin Hidimva was formerly deflowered by him, disregarding us and the<br>other Rakshasas. I am here, O king, to slay that Bhima with all his<br>followers, steeds, cars, and elephants, as also that son of Hidimva with<br>friends. Slaying today all the sons of Kunti, Vasudeva and others that<br>walk before them, I will devour them with all their followers. Command<br>all thy troops to desist from battle. We will fight with the Pandavas.'<br><br>"Hearing these words of his, Duryodhana became very glad. Surrounded by<br>his brothers, the king, accepting the words of the Rakshasa, said,<br>'Placing thee with thine in the van, we will fight the foe. My troops<br>will not stand as indifferent spectators since their enmity has not<br>cooled.' That bull amongst Rakshasa, saying, 'Let it be so,' unto the<br>king, speedily proceeded against Bhima, accompanied by his cannibal<br>force. Endued with a blazing form, Alayudha rode a car bright like the<br>sun. Indeed, O monarch, that car of his was similar to Ghatotkacha's car.<br>The rattle also of Alayudha's car was as deep as that of Ghatotkacha's,<br>and it was decked with many arches. That large car was covered with<br>bear-skins, and its measure was a nalwa. His steeds, like those of<br>Ghatotkacha, were endued with great speed, resembled elephants in shape,<br>and had the voice of asses. Subsisting on flesh and blood and gigantic in<br>size, a hundred of them were yoked unto his vehicle. Indeed, the rattle<br>of his car, like that of his rival, was loud and strong, and its string<br>was as hard. His shafts also, winged with gold and whetted on stone, were<br>as large as Ghatotkacha's, being of the measure of Akshas. The heroic<br>Alayudha was as mighty-armed as Ghatotkacha, and the standard of his car,<br>endued with the splendour of the sun or fire, was, like Ghatotkacha's,<br>pierced upon by vultures and ravens. In form, he was more handsome than<br>Ghatotkacha, and his face, agitated (with wrath) looked blazing. With<br>blazing Angadas and blazing diadem and garlands, decked with floral<br>wreaths and headgear and sword armed with mace and Bhushundis and short<br>clubs and ploughs and bows and arrows, and with skin black and hard as<br>that of the elephant, riding on that car possessed of the splendour of<br>fire, he looked, while employed in afflicting and routing the Pandava<br>host, like a roving cloud in the welkin, decked with flashes of lighting.<br>(As Alayudha came to battle), the principal kings of the Pandava army<br>endued with great might, and armed with (sword and) shield, and clad in<br>mail, engaged in fight, O king, with joyous hearts.'"
