                    "Sanjaya said, 'The ruler of the Madras shrouded on all sides, with<br>clouds of shafts, Virata with his troops, who was proceeding quickly for<br>getting at Drona. The battle that took place between those two great<br>bowmen resembled, O king, that between Vala and Vasava in days of yore.<br>The ruler of the Madras, O monarch, with great activity, struck Virata,<br>that commander of a large division, with a hundred straight shafts. King<br>Virata, in return, pierced the ruler of the Madras with nine keen arrows,<br>and once more with three and seventy, and once again with a hundred. The<br>ruler of the Madras, then, slaying the four steeds yoked unto Virata's<br>car, cut down with a couple of shafts, the latter's umbrella and<br>standard. Quickly jumping down from that steedless car, the king stood,<br>drawing his bow and shooting keen shafts. Beholding his brother deprived<br>of his steeds, Satanika quickly approached him on his car in the very<br>sight of all the troops. The ruler of the Madras, however, piercing the<br>advancing Satanika with many shafts, despatched him to the abode of Yama.<br>Upon the fall of the heroic Satanika, Virata, that commander of a large<br>division, ascended the fallen hero's car, decked with standard and<br>garlands.<span class="footnote-tooltip" style="color:rgb(255,193,7);"><sup><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i></sup><span class="footnote-tooltip-text">'The second line of 9 is read differently in the Calcutta edition. I adopt the Bombay reading.  </span></span> opening his eyes wide, and with prowess doubled by wrath,<br>Virata quickly covered the car of the ruler of the Madras with winged<br>arrows. The ruler of the Madras then, excited with rage, deeply pierced<br>Virata, that commander of a large division, in the chest, with a hundred<br>straight shafts. Deeply pierced by the mighty ruler of the Madras, that<br>great car-warrior, viz., Virata, sat down on the terrace of his car and<br>swooned away. His driver, then, beholding him mangled with shafts in that<br>encounter, bore him away. Then that vast force, O Bharata, fled away on<br>that night, oppressed by hundreds of arrows of Salya, that ornament of<br>battle. Beholding the troops flying away, Vasudeva and Dhananjaya quickly<br>advanced to that spot, O monarch, where Salya was stationed. Then that<br>prince of the Rakshasas, viz., Alamvusha, O king, riding upon a foremost<br>car, harnessed with eight steeds, having terrible-looking Pisachas of<br>equine faces yoked unto it, furnished with blood-red banners, decked with<br>floral garlands made of black iron, covered with bear-skins, and<br>possessing a tall standard over which perched a terrible, fierce-looking,<br>and incessantly shrieking vulture, of spotted wings and wide-open eyes,<br>proceeded against those advancing heroes. That Rakshasa, O king, looked<br>beautiful like a loose heap of antimony, and he withstood the advancing<br>Arjuna, like Meru withstanding a tempest, scattering showers of arrows, O<br>monarch, upon Arjuna's head. The battle then that commenced between the<br>Rakshasa and that human warrior, was exceedingly fierce. And it filled<br>all the spectators there, O Bharata, with wonder. And it conduced to the<br>joy also of vultures and crows, of ravens and owls and Kanakas and<br>jackals. Arjuna struck Alamvusha with six shafts and then cut off his<br>standard with ten sharp arrows. With a few other arrows, he cut off his<br>driver, and with some others his Trivenu, and with one more, his bow, and<br>with four others his four steeds. Alamvusha strung another bow, but that<br>also Arjuna cut off in two fragments. Then, O bull of Bharata's race,<br>Partha pierced that prince of the Rakshasas with four keen arrows. Thus<br>pierced, the Rakshasas fled away in fear. Having vanquished him, Arjuna<br>quickly proceeded towards the spot where Drona was, shooting as he went,<br>many shafts, O king, at men, elephants, and steeds. Slaughtered O<br>monarch, by the illustrious son of Pandu, the combatants fell down on the<br>ground, like trees laid low by a tempest. Thus treated by the illustrious<br>son of Pandu, all of them fled like a frightened herd of deer.'"
