                    "Sanjaya said, 'Having vanquished Drona and other warriors of thy army,<br>headed by the son of Haridika, that foremost of men, viz., that bull<br>amongst the Sinis, O foremost one of the Kurus, laughing said unto his<br>charioteer, 'Our foes, O Suta, had already been consumed by Kesava and<br>Phalguna. In vanquishing them (again), we have only been the (ostensible)<br>means. Already slain by that bull among men, viz., the son of the<br>celestial chief, we have but slain the dead.' Saying these words unto his<br>charioteer, that bull amongst the Sinis, that foremost of bowmen, that<br>slayer of hostile heroes, that mighty warrior, scattering with great<br>force his arrows all around in that dreadful battle, proceeded like a<br>hawk in search of prey. The Kuru warriors, although they attacked him<br>from all sides, succeeded not in resisting that foremost of car-warriors,<br>resembling the sun himself of a thousand rays, that foremost of men, who,<br>having pierced the Kaurava ranks, was proceeding, borne by those<br>excellent steeds of his that were white as the moon or a conch. Indeed, O<br>Bharata, none amongst those that fought on thy side could resist<br>Yuyudhana of irresistible prowess, of might incapable of impairment, of<br>valour equal to that Of him of a thousand eyes, and looking like the<br>autumnal sun in the firmament. Then that foremost of kings, viz.,<br>Sudarsana, conversant with all modes of warfare, clad in golden coat of<br>mail, armed with bow and arrows and filled with rage, advanced against<br>the rushing Satyaki and endeavoured to check his course. Then the<br>encounter that took place between them was fierce in the extreme. And<br>both thy warriors and the Somakas, O king highly applauded the encounter<br>as between Vritra and Vasava. Sudarsana endeavoured to pierce that<br>foremost one of the Satwata's in that battle with hundreds of keen shafts<br>before they could reach him. Similarly, Sudarsana, stationed on his<br>foremost of cars, cut off, by means of his own excellent shafts in two or<br>three fragments all the shafts that Satyaki, resembling Indra himself,<br>sped at him. Beholding his shafts baffled by the force of Satyaki's<br>shafts, Sudarsana of fierce energy, as if to consume (his foe),<br>wrathfully shot beautiful arrows winged with gold. And once more he<br>pierced his enemy with three beautiful arrows resembling fire itself and<br>equipped with wings of gold, shot from his bow-string drawn to the ear.<br>Those piercing through Satyaki's armour, penetrated into the latter's<br>body. Similarly, that (prince, viz., Sudarsana), aiming four other<br>blazing arrows, smote therewith the four steeds of Satyaki that were<br>white as silver in hue. Thus afflicted by him the grandson of Sini,<br>endued with great activity and possessed of prowess equal to that of<br>Indra himself speedily slew with his keen shafts the steeds of Sudarsana<br>and uttered a loud roar. Then cutting off with a broad-headed arrow<br>endued with the force of Sakra's thunder, the head of Sudarsana's driver,<br>the foremost one amongst the Sinis. with a razor-faced arrow resembling<br>the Yuga-fire, cut off from Sudarsana's trunk his head graced with<br>ear-rings, resembling the moon at full, and decked with an exceedingly<br>radiant face, like the wielder of the thunder, O king, in days of old,<br>forcibly cutting off the head of the mighty Vala in battle. That<br>high-souled bull among the Yadus then, endued with great activity thus<br>slaying that grandson of a prince, became filled with delight and shone<br>resplendent, O monarch, like the chief of the celestials himself.<br>Yuyudhana, then, that hero among men, proceeded along the track by which<br>Arjuna had passed before him, checking (as he went) by means of clouds of<br>shafts, all thy troops, and riding on that same car of his, O king, unto<br>which were yoked those excellent steeds and filling everybody with<br>amazement. All the foremost of warriors there, assembled together,<br>applauded that foremost of amazing feats achieved by him, for he consumed<br>all foes that came within reach of his arrows, like a conflagration<br>consuming everything in its way.'"
