                    "Sanjaya said, 'Unto him who was talking thus, the aged Kuru grandsire<br>with a cheerful heart, said these words adapted to both time and place:<br>'Like the ocean unto rivers, like the Sun unto all luminous bodies, like<br>the righteous unto Truth, like a fertile soil unto seeds, like the clouds<br>unto all creatures, be thou the refuge of thy relatives and friends! Like<br>the celestials upon him of a thousand eyes, let thy kinsmen depend on<br>thee. Be thou the humiliator of thy foes, and the enhancer of the joys of<br>thy friends. Be thou unto the Kauravas as Vishnu unto the dwellers of<br>heaven. Desirous of doing what was agreeable to Dhritarashtra's son, thou<br>didst with the might and prowess of own arms, O Karna, vanquish the<br>Kamvojas having proceeded to Rajpura. Many kings, amongst whom Nagnajit<br>was the foremost, while staying in Girivraja, as also the Amvashthas, the<br>Videhas, and the Gandharvas, were all vanquished by thee. The Kiratas,<br>fierce in battle, dwelling in the fastness of Himavat, were formerly, O<br>Karna, made by thee to own Duryodhana's sway. And so also, the Utpalas,<br>the Mekalas, the Paundras, the Kalingas, the Andhras, the Nishadas, the<br>Trigartas, and the Valhikas, were all vanquished by thee, O Karna, in<br>battle. In many other countries, O Karna, impelled by the desire of doing<br>good to Duryodhana, thou didst, O hero, vanquish many races and kings of<br>great energy. Like Duryodhana, O child, with his kinsmen, and relatives,<br>and friends, be thou also the refuge of all the Kauravas. In auspicious<br>words I command thee, go and fight with the enemy. Lead the Kurus in<br>battle, and give victory unto Duryodhana. Thou art to us our grandson<br>even as Duryodhana is. According to the ordinance, all of us also are as<br>much thine as Duryodhana's!<span class="footnote-tooltip" style="color:rgb(255,193,7);"><sup><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i></sup><span class="footnote-tooltip-text">The second fine of 12 is read incorrectly in the Bengal text. Instead of tathapi the true reading (as in the Bombay edition) is tavapi.  </span></span>The wise, O foremost of men, say that the<br>companionship of the righteous with the righteous is a superior<br>relationship to that born of the same womb. Without falsifying,<br>therefore, thy relationship with Kurus, protect thou the Kaurava host<br>like Duryodhana, regarding it as thy own.<br><br>"Hearing these words of his, Vikartana's. son Karna, reverentially<br>saluting Bhishma's feet, (bade him farewell) and came to that spot where<br>all the Kaurava bowmen were. Viewing that wide and unparalleled<br>encampment of the vast host, he began to cherish (by words of<br>encouragement) those well-armed and broad-chested warriors. And all the<br>Kauravas headed by Duryodhana were filled with joy. And beholding the<br>mighty-armed and high-souled Karna come to the field and station himself<br>at the head of the whole army, for battle, the Kauravas received him with<br>loud shouts and slapping of arm-pits and leonine roars and twang of bows<br>and diverse other kinds of noise.'"
