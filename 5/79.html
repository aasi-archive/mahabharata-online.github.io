                    "The holy one said, 'It shall be, O thou of mighty arms, what thou, O<br>Pandavas, sayest, I will strive to bring about that which would be<br>beneficial to both the Pandavas and the Kurus. Between the two kinds of<br>acts, war and peace, the latter, O Vibhatsu, is perhaps within my power.<br>Behold, the soil is moistened and divested of weeds by human exertion.<br>Without rain, however, O son of Kunti, is never yieldeth crops. Indeed,<br>in the absence of rain some speak of artificial irrigation, as a means of<br>success due to human exertion, but even then it may be seen that the<br>water artificially let in is dried up in consequence of providential<br>drought. Beholding all this, the wise men of old have said that human<br>affairs are set agoing in consequence of the cooperation of both<br>providential and human expedients. I will do all that can be done by<br>human exertion at its best. But I shall, by no means, be able to control<br>what is providential. The wicked-souled Duryodhana acteth, defying both<br>virtue and the world. Nor doth he feel any regret in consequence of his<br>acting in that way. Moreover, his sinful inclinations are fed by his<br>counsellors Sakuni and Karna and his brother Dussasana. Suyodhana will<br>never make peace by giving up the kingdom, without, O Partha, undergoing<br>at our hands a wholesale destruction with his kinsmen. King Yudhishthira<br>the just doth not wish to give up the kingdom submissively. The<br>wicked-minded Duryodhana also will not at our solicitation surrender the<br>kingdom. I, therefore, think that it is scarcely proper to deliver<br>Yudhishthira's message to him. The sinful Duryodhana of Kuru's race will<br>not, O Bharata, accomplish the objects spoken of by Yudhishthira. If he<br>refuses compliance, he will deserve death at the hands of all. Indeed, he<br>deserves death at my hands, as also, O Bharata, of every one since in<br>your childhood he always persecuted you all, and since that wicked and<br>sinful wretch robbed you of your kingdom and could not bear the sight of<br>Yudhishthira's prosperity. Many a time, O Partha, he strove to withdraw<br>me from thee, but I never reckoned those wicked attempts of his. Thou<br>knowest, O thou of mighty arms, what the cherished intentions of<br>Duryodhana are, and thou knowest also that I seek the welfare of king<br>Yudhishthira the just. Knowing, therefore, Duryodhana's heart and what my<br>most cherished wishes are, why then dost thou, O Arjuna, entertain such<br>apprehensions in respect of myself like one unacquainted with everything?<br>That grave act also which was ordained in heaven is known to thee, How<br>then, O Partha, can peace be concluded with the foe? What, however, O<br>Pandavas, is capable of being done by either speech or act, will all be<br>done by me. Do not, however, O Partha, expect peace to be possible with<br>the foe. About a year ago, on the occasion of attacking Virata's kine,<br>did not Bhishma, on their way back, solicit Duryodhana about this very<br>peace so beneficial to all? Believe me, they have been defeated even then<br>when their defeat was resolved by thee. Indeed, Suyodhana doth not<br>consent to part with the smallest portion of the kingdom for even the<br>shortest period of time. As regards myself, I am ever obedient to the<br>commands of Yudhishthira, and, therefore, the sinful acts of that wicked<br>wretch must have again to be revolved in my mind!'"
