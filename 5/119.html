                    "Narada said, 'Seeing Galava, Vinata's son smilingly addressed him,<br>saying, 'By good luck it is, O Brahmana, that I behold thee successful.'<br>Galava, however, hearing the words spoken by Garuda informed him that a<br>fourth part of the task was still un-finished.' Garuda then, that<br>foremost of all speakers, said unto Galava, 'Do not make any endeavour<br>(to obtain the remaining two hundred), for it will not succeed. In days<br>of yore, Richika sought at Kanyakuyja Gadhi's daughter, Satyavati, for<br>making her his wife.' Thereupon Gadhi, O Galava, addressing the Rishi,<br>said, 'O holy one, let a thousand steeds of lunar brightness, each with<br>one ear black of hue, be presented to me.' Thus requested, Richika said,<br>'So be it'. And then wending his way to the great mart of steeds<br>(Aswatirtha) in Varuna's abode, the Rishi obtained what he sought and<br>gave them unto the king. Performing a sacrifice then of the name of<br>Pundarika, that monarch gave away those steeds (as Dakshina) unto the<br>Brahmanas. The three kings to whom thou hadst applied had purchased those<br>horses from the Brahmanas, each to the number of two hundred. The<br>remaining four hundred, O best of Brahmanas, while being transported over<br>the river, were taken by the Vitasta.<span class="footnote-tooltip" style="color:rgb(255,193,7);"><sup><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i></sup><span class="footnote-tooltip-text">The latter half of this Sloka is variously read. The correct reading, I apprehend, is Niyamanani Santare Hritanyasan Vitastaya, i.e., 'while transported across, were taken (down) by the (river) Vitasta'--the latter being one of the five rivers of the Punjab.  </span></span>Therefore, O Galava, thou canst<br>never have that which is not to be had. Do thou then, O virtuous one,<br>present unto Viswamitra this maiden as an equivalent for two hundred<br>steeds, along with the six hundred thou hast already obtained. Thou wilt<br>then, O best of Brahmanas, be freed from thy grief and crowned with<br>success. Galava then, saying, 'So be it,' and taking with him both the<br>maiden and the steeds, went with Garuda in his company unto Viswamitra.<br>And arrived in his presence, Galava said, 'Here are six hundred steeds of<br>the kind demanded by thee. And this maiden is offered as an equivalent<br>for the remaining two hundred. Let all these be accepted by thee. Upon<br>this maiden have been begotten three virtuous sons by three royal sages.<br>Let a fourth, foremost of all, be begotten upon her by thee. And thus let<br>the number of steeds, eight hundred, be regarded by thee as full, and let<br>me also, being freed from thy debt, go and practise ascetic penances as I<br>list.' Viswamitra then, beholding Galava in the company of the bird, and<br>that highly beautiful maiden, said, 'Why, O Galava, didst thou not give<br>me this maiden before? Four sons then, sanctifiers of my race, would all<br>have been mine alone. I accept this maiden of thine for begetting upon<br>her one son. As regards the steeds, let them graze in my asylum.' Saying<br>this, Viswamitra of great effulgence began to pass his time happily with<br>her, And Madhavi bore him a son of the name of Ashtaka. And as soon as<br>that son was born, the great Muni Viswamitra addressed him to both virtue<br>and profit, and gave him those six hundred steeds. Ashtaka then went to a<br>city, bright as the city of Soma. And Kusika's son Viswamitra also having<br>made over the damsel to his disciple, himself went into the Woods. And<br>Galava also, with his friend Suparna, having in this way succeeded in<br>giving his preceptor the fee he had demanded, with a cheerful heart<br>addressed that maiden and said, 'Thou hast borne a son who is exceedingly<br>charitable, and another who is exceedingly brave, and a third who is<br>devoted to truth and righteousness, and yet another who is a performer of<br>great sacrifices. O beautiful maiden, thou hast, by these sons, saved not<br>only thy father, but four kings and myself, also. Go now, O thou of<br>slender waist.' Saying this, Galava dismissed Garuda that devourer of<br>snakes, and returning the maiden unto her father himself went into the<br>woods.'"
