                    "Vaisampayana said, 'Having listened to the words of Jamadagnya, the<br>illustrious Rishi Kanwa also said these words unto Duryodhana in that<br>assembly of the Kurus.'<br><br>"Kanwa said, 'Brahman, the Grandsire of the universe, is indestructible<br>and eternal. Those illustrious Rishis, Nara and Narayana, are of the same<br>character. Of all the sons of Aditi, Vishnu alone is eternal. He alone is<br>unconquerable and indestructible, existing for ever, the Lord of all, and<br>the possessor of divine attributes. All others, such as the sun and the<br>moon, earth and water, wind, fire and firmament, planets, and stars, are<br>liable to destruction. All these, when the end of the universe cometh,<br>take leave of the three worlds. They are destroyed and created again and<br>again. Others also, such as men and animals and birds, and creatures<br>belonging to other orders of living existence,&#8212;indeed, all that move on<br>this world of men,&#8212;are endued with short lives. And as regards kings,<br>all of them, having enjoyed great prosperity, reach, at last, the hour of<br>destruction and are reborn in order to enjoy the fruits of good and evil<br>deeds. It behoveth thee then to make peace with Yudhishthira. Let the<br>Pandavas and the Kauravas both rule this earth. O Suyodhana, one should<br>not think in this way, viz., I am strong!&#8212;for O bull among men, it is<br>seen that there are persons stronger than those generally regarded<br>strong. O son of Kuru's race, physical strength is scarcely regarded as<br>strength by those that are really strong. As regards the Pandavas, endued<br>as they all are with prowess equal to that of the celestials, they are<br>also regarded as strong. In this connection is cited an old story, as an<br>example, the story, viz., of Matali searching for a bridegroom upon whom<br>to bestow his daughter. The king of the three worlds (Indra) had a<br>charioteer, named Matali, whom he dearly loved. Unto him was born a<br>daughter celebrated over the world for beauty. Endued with the celestial<br>beauty, that daughter of Matali was known by the name of Gunakesi. And,<br>indeed, in both loveliness and symmetry of bodily figure, she far<br>excelled other members of her sex. Knowing that the time for giving her<br>way had come, Matali with his wife became very anxious, thinking, O<br>monarch, of what he was to do next. And he thought within himself, 'Alas,<br>the birth of a daughter in the families of those that are well-behaved<br>and high-born and possess reputation and humility of character, is always<br>attended with evil results. Daughters, when born in respectable families,<br>always endanger the honour of three families, viz., their maternal and<br>paternal families and the family into which they are adopted by marriage.<br>Glancing in my mind's eye the worlds of gods and men, I have searched<br>both, but no eligible bridegroom have I found.'<br><br>"Kanwa continued, 'And it so happened that amongst the gods, the Daityas<br>and Gandharvas, men and numerous Rishis, none was regarded by Matali as<br>an eligible husband for his daughter. And having held a consultation then<br>in the night with his wife Sudharma, Matali set his heart upon making a<br>journey to the world of the Nagas. And he thought within himself,<br>'Amongst both gods and men I have not found a husband fit, in respect of<br>beauty, for my Gunakesi. Surely, one may be found amongst the Nagas.' And<br>saying this, he took his wife's leave and sniffing the head of his<br>daughter, Matali entered the nether regions.'"
