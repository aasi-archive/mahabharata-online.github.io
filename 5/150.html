                    "Vasudeva said, 'Though thus addressed by Bhishma, and Drona, and Vidura,<br>and Gandhari, and Dhritarashtra, that wicked wight could not yet be<br>brought to his senses. On the other hand, the wicked Duryodhana,<br>disregarding them all, rose (and left the assembly) with eyes red in<br>anger. And all the kings (invited by him), prepared to lay down their<br>lives, followed him behind. King Duryodhana then repeatedly ordered those<br>wicked-hearted rulers, saying, 'Today constellation Pushya is<br>ascendant&#8212;march ye (this very day) to Kurukshetra. Impelled by Fate,<br>those monarchs then, with their soldiers, gladly set out, making Bhishma<br>their generalissimo. Eleven Akshauhinis of troops have been, O King,<br>assembled for the Kauravas. At the head of that host, shineth Bhishma,<br>with the device of the palmyra on the banner of his car. In view,<br>therefore, of What hath happened, do now, O monarch, that which seemeth<br>to be proper. I have told thee, O king, everything that, O Bharata, that<br>was said by Bhishma, Drona, Vidura, Gandhari and Dhritarashtra, in my<br>presence. The arts beginning with conciliation were all, O king, employed<br>by me from desire of establishing brotherly feelings (between yourselves<br>and your cousins), for the preservation of this race, and for the growth<br>and prosperity of the (earth's) population. When conciliation failed, I<br>employed the art of (producing) dissensions and mentioned, ye Pandavas,<br>all your ordinary and extraordinary feats. Indeed, when Suyodhana showed<br>no respect for the conciliatory words, (I spoke), I caused all the kings<br>to be assembled together and endeavoured to produce dissension (amongst<br>them). Extraordinary and awful and terrible and superhuman indications,<br>O, Bharata, were then manifested by me. O lord, rebuking all the kings,<br>making a straw of Suyodhana, terrifying Radha's son and repeatedly<br>censuring Suvala's son for the gambling match of Dhritarashtra's sons,<br>and once again endeavouring to disunite all the kings by means of both<br>words and intrigues, I again had recourse to conciliation. For the unity<br>of Kuru's race and in view of the special requirements of the business<br>(at hand), I spoke also of gift. Indeed, I said, 'Those heroes, the sons<br>of Pandu, sacrificing their pride, will live in dependence on<br>Dhritarashtra, Bhishma and Vidura. Let the kingdom be given to thee. Let<br>them have no power. Let: it all be as the king (Dhritarashtra), as<br>Ganga's son (Bhishma) and as Vidura say for thy good. Let the kingdom be<br>thine. Relinquish but five villages (to the Pandavas). O best of kings,<br>without doubt they deserve to be supported by thy father. Though<br>addressed thus, that wicked soul do not still give you your share. I,<br>therefore, see that chastisement, and nothing else, is now the means that<br>should be employed against those sinful persons. Indeed, all those kings<br>have already marched to, Kurukshetra. I have now told thee everything<br>that had happened in the assembly of the Kurus. They will not, O son of<br>Pandu, give thee thy kingdom without battle. With death waiting before<br>them, they have all become the cause of a universal destruction.'"
