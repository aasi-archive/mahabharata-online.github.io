                    "Vaisampayana said, 'Thus conversing with Sanat-sujata and the learned<br>Vidura, the king passed that night. And after the night had passed away,<br>all the princes and chiefs, entered the court-hall with joyous hearts and<br>desirous of seeing that Suta (who had returned). And anxious to hear the<br>message of Partha's, fraught with virtue and profit, all the kings with<br>Dhritarashtra at their head, went to that beautiful hall. Spotlessly<br>white and spacious, it was adorned with a golden floor. And effulgent as<br>the moon and exceedingly beautiful, it was sprinkled over with<br>sandal-water. And it was spread over with excellent seats made of gold<br>and wood, and marble and ivory. And all the seats were wrapped with<br>excellent covers. And Bhishma and Drona and Kripa and Salya, and<br>Kritavarman and Jayadratha, and Aswatthaman and Vikarna, and Somadatta<br>and Vahlika and Vidura of great wisdom and Yuyutsu, the great<br>car-warrior,&#8212;all these heroic kings in a body, O bull among the<br>Bharatas, having Dhritarashtra at their head, entered that hall of great<br>beauty. And Dussasana and Chitrasena, and Sakuni, the son of Suvala, and<br>Durmukha and Dussaha, Karna and Uluka and Vivingsati,&#8212;these also, with<br>Duryodhana, the wrathful king of the Kurus, at their head, entered that<br>hall, O monarch, like the celestials forming the train of Sakra himself.<br>And filled with these heroes possessed of arms like maces of iron, that<br>hall looked, O king, like a mountain-cave filled with lions. And all<br>these mighty bowmen, endued with great energy and blazing, with solar<br>effulgence, entering the hall, seated themselves on those beautiful<br>seats. And after all those kings, O Bharata, had taken their seats, the<br>orderly-in-waiting announced the arrival of the Suta's son, saying,<br>'Yonder cometh the car that was despatched to the Pandavas. Our envoy<br>hath returned quickly, by the aid of well-trained steeds of the, Sindhu<br>breed.' And having approached the place with speed and alighted from the<br>car, Sanjaya adorned with ear-rings entered that hall full of high-souled<br>kings. And the Suta said, 'Ye Kauravas, know that having gone to the<br>Pandavas I am just returning from them. The sons of Pandu offer their<br>congratulations to all the Kurus according to the age of each. Having<br>offered their respects in return, the sons of Pritha have saluted the<br>aged ones, and those that are equal to them in years, and those also that<br>are younger, just as each should, according to his years, be saluted.<br>Listen, ye kings, to what I, instructed before by Dhritarashtra, said to<br>the Pandavas, having gone to them from this place.'
