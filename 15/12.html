                    "Arjuna said, 'O Bhima, thou art my elder brother and, therefore, my<br>senior and preceptor. I dare not say anything more than what I have<br>already said. The royal sage Dhritarashtra deserves to be honoured by us<br>in every respect. They that are good, they that are distinguished above<br>the common level, they that break not the distinctions which characterise<br>the good, remember not the wrongs done to them but only the benefits they<br>have received.' Hearing these words of the high-souled Phalguna, the<br>righteous-souled Yudhishthira, the son of Kunti, addressed Vidura and<br>said these words, 'Instructed by me, O Kshattri, do thou say unto the<br>Kuru king that I shall give him as much wealth from my treasury as he<br>wishes to give away for the obsequies of his song, and of Bhishma and<br>others among his well-wishers and benefactors. Let not Bhima be cheerless<br>at this!'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'Having said these words, king Yudhishthira the<br>just, highly applauded Arjuna. Meanwhile Bhimasena began to cast angry<br>glances at Dhananjaya. Then Yudhishthira, endued with great intelligence,<br>once more addressed Vidura and said, 'It behoves not king Dhritarashtra<br>to be angry with Bhimasena. This Bhima of great intelligence was greatly<br>afflicted by cold and rain and heat and by a thousand other griefs while<br>residing in the woods. All this is not unknown to thee. Do thou, however,<br>instructed by me, say unto the king, O foremost one of Bharata's race,<br>that he may take from my house whatever articles he wishes and in<br>whatever measure also he likes. Thou shalt also tell the king that he<br>should not allow his heart to dwell on this exhibition of pride in which<br>Bhima, deeply afflicted, has indulged. Whatever wealth I have and<br>whatever Arjuna has in his house, the owner thereof is king<br>Dhritarashtra. Even this thou shouldst tell him. Let the king make gifts<br>unto the Brahmanas. Let him spend as largely as he likes. Let him free<br>himself from the debt he owes to his sons and well-wishers. Let him be<br>told besides,&#8212;O Monarch, this very body of mine is at thy disposal and<br>all the wealth I have. Know this, and let there be no doubt in this.
