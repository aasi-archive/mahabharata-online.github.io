                    "Vaisampayana said, 'Thus insulted by the Suta's son, that illustrious<br>princess, the beautiful Krishna, eagerly wishing for the destruction of<br>Virata's general, went to her quarters. And Drupada's daughter of dark<br>hue and slender waist then performed her ablutions. And washing her body<br>and cloths with water Krishna began to ponder weepingly on the means of<br>dispelling her grief. And she reflected, saying, 'What am I to do?<br>Whither shall I go? How can my purpose be effected?' And while she was<br>thinking thus, she remembered Bhima and said to herself, 'There is none<br>else, save Bhima, that can today accomplish the purpose on which my heart<br>is set!' And afflicted with great grief, the large-eyed and intelligent<br>Krishna possessed of powerful protectors then rose up at night, and<br>leaving her bed speedily proceeded towards the quarters of Bhimasena,<br>desirous of beholding her lord. And possessed of great intelligence, the<br>daughter of Drupada entered her husband's quarters, saying, 'How canst<br>thou sleep while that wretched commander of Virata's forces, who is my<br>foe, yet liveth, having perpetrated today that (foul act)?'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'Then the chamber where Bhima slept, breathing<br>hard like a lion, being filled with the beauty of Drupada's daughter and<br>of the high-souled Bhima, blazed forth in splendour. And Krishna of sweet<br>smiles, finding Bhimasena in the cooking apartments, approached him with<br>the eagerness of a three-year old cow brought up in the woods,<br>approaching a powerful bull, in her first season, or of a she-crane<br>living by the water-side approaching her mate in the pairing season. And<br>the Princess of Panchala then embraced the second son of Pandu, even as a<br>creeper embraces a huge and mighty Sala on the banks of the Gomati. And<br>embracing him with her arms, Krishna of faultless features awaked him as<br>a lioness awaketh a sleeping lion in a trackless forest. And embracing<br>Bhimasena even as a she-elephant embraceth her mighty mate, the faultless<br>Panchali addressed him in voice sweet as the sound of a stringed<br>instrument emitting Gandhara note. And she said, 'Arise, arise! Why dost<br>thou, O Bhimasena, lie down as one dead? Surely, he that is not dead,<br>never suffereth a wicked wretch that hath disgraced his wife, to live.'<br>And awakened by the princess, Bhima of mighty arms, then rose up, and sat<br>upon his couch overlaid with a rich bed. And he of the Kuru race then<br>addressed the princess&#8212;his beloved wife, saying, 'For what purpose hast<br>thou come hither in such a hurry? Thy colour is gone and thou lookest<br>lean and pale. Tell me everything in detail. I must know the truth.<br>Whether it be pleasurable or painful, agreeable, or disagreeable, tell me<br>all. Having heard everything, I shall apply the remedy. I alone, O<br>Krishna, am entitled to thy confidence in all things, for it is I who<br>deliver thee from perils again and again! Tell me quickly what is thy<br>wish, and what is the purpose that is in thy view, and return thou to thy<br>bed before others awake.'"
