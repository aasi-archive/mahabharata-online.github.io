Whose<br>is this excellent bow of good sides and easy hold, on the staff of which<br>shine golden elephants of such brightness? Whose is this excellent bow,<br>adorned with three scores of Indragoapkas <span class="footnote-tooltip" style="color:rgb(255,193,7);"><sup><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i></sup><span class="footnote-tooltip-text">Indian insects of a particular kind.  </span></span> of pure gold, placed on<br>the back of the staff at proper intervals? Whose is this excellent bow,<br>furnished with three golden suns of great effulgence, blazing forth with<br>such brilliancy? Whose is this beautiful bow which is variegated with<br>gold and gems, and on which are golden insects set with beautiful stones?<br>Whose are these arrows furnished with wing around, numbering a thousand,<br>having golden heads, and cased in golden quivers? Who owneth these large<br>shafts, so thick, furnished with vulturine wings whetted on stone,<br>yellowish in hue, sharp-pointed, well-tempered, and entirely made of<br>iron? Whose is this sable quiver, <span class="footnote-tooltip" style="color:rgb(255,193,7);"><sup><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i></sup><span class="footnote-tooltip-text">Most editions read chapas which is evidently wrong.

Whose are these seven hundred arrows, long and thick,<br>capable of drinking (the enemy's) blood, and looking like the<br>crescent-shaped moon? <span class="footnote-tooltip" style="color:rgb(255,193,7);"><sup><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i></sup><span class="footnote-tooltip-text">Some read chandrargha-darsanas.

Whose is this handsome scimitar of polished blade and<br>golden hilt? Manufactured in the country of the Nishadas, irresistible,<br>incapable of being broken, whose is this sword of polished blade in a<br>scabbard of cow-skin? Whose is this beautiful and long sword, sable in<br>hue as the sky, mounted with gold, well-tempered, and cased in a sheath<br>of goat-skin? Who owneth this heavy, well-tempered, and broad sword, just<br>longer than the breadth of thirty fingers, polished by constant clash<br>with other's weapons and kept in a case of gold, bright as fire? Whose is<br>this beautiful scimitar of sable blade covered with golden bosses,<br>capable of cutting through the bodies of adversaries, whose touch is as<br>fatal as that of a venomous snake which is irresistible and exciteth the<br>terror of foes? Asked by me, O Vrihannala, do thou answer me truly. Great<br>is my wonder at the sight of all these excellent objects.'"
