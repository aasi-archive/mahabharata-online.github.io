                    Yudhishthira said, "Tender, possessed of a graceful presence, and<br>deserving of every luxury as thou art, what office wilt thou, O heroic<br>Nakula, discharge while living in the dominions of that king? Tell me all<br>about it!"<br><br>Nakula said, "Under the name of Granthika, I shall become the keeper of<br>the horses of king Virata. I have a thorough knowledge (of this work) and<br>am skilful in tending horses. Besides, the task is agreeable to me, and I<br>possess great skill in training and treating horses; and horses are ever<br>dear to me as they are to thee, O king of the Kurus. At my hands even<br>colts and mares become docile; these never become vicious in bearing a<br>rider or drawing a car.<span class="footnote-tooltip" style="color:rgb(255,193,7);"><sup><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i></sup><span class="footnote-tooltip-text">The sloka commencing with Adushta and ending ratheshu cha does not occur in texts except those in Bengal.  </span></span> And those persons in the city of Virata that<br>may enquire of me, I shall, O bull of the Bharata race, say,&#8212;Formerly I<br>was employed by Yudhishthira in the charge of his horses. Thus disguised,<br>O king, I shall spend my days delightfully in the city of Virata. No one<br>will be able to discover me as I will gratify the monarch thus!<span class="footnote-tooltip" style="color:rgb(255,193,7);"><sup><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i></sup><span class="footnote-tooltip-text">A difference reading is observable here. The sense, however, is the same.  </span></span><br><br>Yudhishthira said, "How wilt thou, O Sahadeva, bear thyself before that<br>king? And what, O child, is that which thou wilt do in order to live in<br>disguise."<br><br>Sahadeva replied, "I will become a keeper of the kine of Virata's king. I<br>am skilled in milking kine and taking their history as well as in taming<br>their fierceness. Passing under the name of Tantripal, I shall perform my<br>duties deftly. Let thy heart's fever be dispelled. Formerly I was<br>frequently employed to look after thy kine, and, O Lord of earth, I have<br>a particular knowledge of that work. And, O monarch, I am well-acquainted<br>with the nature of kine, as also with their auspicious marks and other<br>matters relating to them. I can also discriminate bulls with auspicious<br>marks, the scent of whose urine may make even the barren being forth<br>child. Even thus will I live, and I always take delight in work of this<br>kind. Indeed, no one will then be able to recognise me, and I will<br>moreover gratify the monarch,"<br><br>Yudhishthira said, "This is our beloved wife dearer to us than our lives.<br>Verily, she deserveth to be cherished by us like a mother, and regarded<br>like an elder sister. Unacquainted as she is with any kind of womanly<br>work, what office will Krishna, the daughter of Drupada, perform?<br>Delicate and young, she is a princess of great repute. Devoted to her<br>lords, and eminently virtuous, also, how will she live? Since her birth,<br>she hath enjoyed only garlands and perfume? and ornaments and costly<br>robes."<br><br>Draupadi replied, "There is a class of persons called Sairindhris,<span class="footnote-tooltip" style="color:rgb(255,193,7);"><sup><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i></sup><span class="footnote-tooltip-text">An independent female artisan working in another person's house.--Wilson.  </span></span> who<br>enter the services of other. Other females, however (that are<br>respectable) do not do so. Of this class there are some. I shall give<br>myself out as a Sairindhri, skilled in dressing hair. And, O Bharata, on<br>being questioned by the king, I shall say that I served as a waiting<br>woman of Draupadi in Yudhishthira's household. I shall thus pass my days<br>in disguise. And I shall serve the famous Sudeshna, the wife of the king.<br>Surely, obtaining me she will cherish me (duly). Do not grieve so, O<br>king."<br><br>"Yudhishthira said, "O Krishna, thou speakest well. But O fair girl, thou<br>wert born in a respectable family. Chaste as thou art, and always engaged<br>in observing virtuous vows, thou knowest not what is sin. Do thou,<br>therefore, conduct thyself in such a way that sinful men of evil hearts<br>may not be gladdened by gazing at thee."
