                    "Vrihannala said, 'That about which thou hath first enquired is Arjuna's<br>bow, of world-wide fame, called Gandiva, capable of devastating hostile<br>hosts. Embellished with gold, this Gandiva, the highest and largest of<br>all weapons belonged to Arjuna. Alone equal unto a hundred thousand<br>weapons, and always capable of extending the confines of kingdoms, it is<br>with this that Partha vanquisheth in battle both men and celestials.<br>Worshipped ever by the gods, the Danavas and the Gandharvas and<br>variegated with excellent colours, this large and smooth bow is without a<br>knot or stain anywhere. Shiva held it first for a thousand years.<br>Afterwards Prajapati held it for five hundred and three years. After that<br>Sakra, for five and eighty years. And then Soma held it for five hundred<br>years. And after that Varuna held it for a hundred years. And finally<br>Partha, surnamed Swetavahana,<span class="footnote-tooltip" style="color:rgb(255,193,7);"><sup><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i></sup><span class="footnote-tooltip-text">From the colour of his steeds.  </span></span> hath held it for five and sixty<br>years.<span class="footnote-tooltip" style="color:rgb(255,193,7);"><sup><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i></sup><span class="footnote-tooltip-text">Nilakantha spends much learning and ingenuity in making out that sixty-five years in this connection means thirty-two years of ordinary human computation.  </span></span> Endued with great energy and of high celestial origin, this is<br>the best of all bows. Adored among gods and men, it hath a handsome form.<br>Partha obtained this beautiful bow from Varuna. This other bow of<br>handsome sides and golden handle is Bhima's with which that son of<br>Pritha, that chastiser of foes, had conquered the whole of the eastern<br>regions. This other excellent bow of beautiful shape, adorned with images<br>of Indragopakas, belongeth, O Virata's son, to king Yudhishthira. This<br>other weapon with golden suns of blazing splendour shedding a dazzling<br>effulgence around, belongeth to Nakula. And this bow adorned with golden<br>images of insects and set also with gems and stones, belongeth to that<br>son of Madri who is called Sahadeva. These winged arrows, thousand in<br>number, sharp as razors and destructive as the poison of snakes, belong,<br>O Virata's son, to Arjuna. When shooting them in battle against foes,<br>these swift arrows blaze forth more brilliantly and become inexhaustible.<br>And these long and thick shafts resembling the lunar crescent in shape,<br>keen-edged and capable of thinning the enemy's ranks, belong to Bhima.<br>And this quiver bearing five images of tigers, full of yellowish shafts<br>whetted on stone and furnished with golden wings belong to Nakula. This<br>is the quiver of the intelligent son of Madri, with which he had<br>conquered in battle the whole of the western regions. And these arrows,<br>all effulgent as, the sun, painted all over with various colours, and<br>capable of destroying enemies by thousands are those of Sahadeva. And<br>these short and well-tempered and thick shafts, furnished with long<br>feathers and golden heads, and consisting of three knots, belong to king<br>Yudhishthira. And this sword with blade long and carved with the image of<br>a toad and head shaped as a toad's mouth, strong and irresistible<br>belongeth to Arjuna. Cased in a sheath of tiger-skin, of long blade,<br>handsome and irresistible, and terrible to adversaries, this sword<br>belongeth to Bhimasena. Of excellent blade and cased in a well-painted<br>sheath, and furnished with a golden hilt, this handsome sword belongeth<br>to the wise Kaurava&#8212;Yudhishthira the just. And this sword of strong<br>blade, irresistible and intended for various excellent modes of fight and<br>cased in a sheath of goat-skin, belongeth to Nakula. And this huge<br>scimitar, cased in a sheath of cow-skin, strong and irresistible<br>belongeth to Sahadeva.'"
