                            "Vaisampayana said, 'Then Saradwata's son, Kripa said, 'What the aged<br>Bhishma hath said concerning the Pandavas is reasonable, suited to the<br>occasion, consistent with virtue and profit, agreeable to the ear,<br>fraught with sound reason, and worthy of him. Listen also to what I would<br>say on this subject. It behoveth thee to ascertain the track they have<br>followed and their abode also by means of spies,<span class="footnote-tooltip" style="color:blue;"><sup><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i></sup><span class="footnote-tooltip-text">The word tirtha here means, as Nilakantha rightly explains spies and not holy spots.  </span></span> and to adopt that<br>policy which may bring about thy welfare. O child, he that is solicitous<br>of his welfare should not disregard even an ordinary foe. What shall I<br>say, then, O child, of the Pandavas who are thorough masters of all<br>weapons in battle. When, therefore, the time cometh for the reappearance<br>of the high-souled Pandavas, who, having entered the forest,<span class="footnote-tooltip" style="color:blue;"><sup><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i></sup><span class="footnote-tooltip-text">Satram is explained by Nilakantha to mean here 'false disguise.' I think, however, such an interpretation to be far-fetched. It evidently means 'forest',--the use of 'pravisteshu' in connection with it almost settles the point.  </span></span> are now<br>passing their days in close disguise, thou shouldst ascertain thy<br>strength both in thy own kingdom and in those of other kings. Without<br>doubt, the return of the Pandavas is at hand. When their promised term of<br>exile is over, the illustrious and mighty sons of Pritha, endued with<br>immeasurable prowess, will come hither bursting with energy. Do thou,<br>therefore, in order to conclude an advantageous treaty with them, have<br>recourse to sound policy and address thyself to increase thy forces and<br>improve the treasury. O child, ascertaining all these, reckon thou thy<br>own strength in respect of all thy allies weak and strong.<span class="footnote-tooltip" style="color:blue;"><sup><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i></sup><span class="footnote-tooltip-text">This sloka is not correctly printed in any of the texts that I have seen. The reading that I adopt is that the second word is the participle of the root budh and not the instrumental of budhi; the last word again of the second line is a compound of valavatsu and avaleshu instead of (as printed in many books) valavatswavaleshu. Any other reading would certainly be incorrect. I have not consulted the Bombay text.  </span></span><br>Ascertaining the efficiency, and weakness, and indifference of thy<br>forces, as also who amongst them are well-affected and who are<br>disaffected, we should either fight the foe or make treaty with him.<br>Having recourse to the arts of conciliation, disunion, chastisement,<br>bribery, presents and fair behaviour, attack thy foes and subdue the weak<br>by might, and win over thy allies and troops and by soft speeches. When<br>thou hast (by these means) strengthened thy army and filled thy treasury,<br>entire success will be thine. When thou hast done all this, thou wilt be<br>able to fight with powerful enemies that may present themselves, let<br>alone the sons of Pandu deficient in troops animals of their own. By<br>adopting all these expedients according to the customs of thy order, thou<br>wilt, O foremost of men, attain enduring happiness in due time!'"
