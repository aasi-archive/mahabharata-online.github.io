                    "Vaisampayana said, 'After a while, another powerful son of Pandu was<br>seen making towards king Virata in haste. And as he advanced, he seemed<br>to everyone like solar orb emerged from the clouds. And he began to<br>observe the horses around. And seeing this, the king of the Matsyas said<br>to his followers, 'I wonder whence this man, possessed of the effulgence<br>of a celestial, cometh. He looks intently at my steeds. Verily, he must<br>be proficient in horse-lore. Let him be ushered into my presence quickly.<br>He is a warrior and looks like a god!' And that destroyer of foes then<br>went up to the king and accosted him, saying, 'Victory to thee, O king,<br>and blest be ye.' As a trainer of horses, I have always been highly<br>esteemed by kings. I will be a clever keeper of thy horses.'<br><br>"Virata said, 'I will give thee vehicles, wealth, and spacious quarters.<br>Thou shalt be the manager of my horses. But first tell me whence thou<br>comest, who thou art, and how also thou happenest to come here. Tell us<br>also all the arts thou art master of.' Nakula replied, 'O mower of<br>enemies, know that Yudhishthira is the eldest brother of the five sons of<br>Pandu. I was formerly employed by him to keep his horses. I am acquainted<br>with the temper of steeds, and know perfectly the art of breaking them. I<br>know also how to correct vicious horses, and all the methods of treating<br>their diseases. No animal in my hands becometh weak or ill. Not to speak<br>of horses, even mares in my hands will never be found to be vicious.<br>People called me Granthika by name and so did Yudhishthira, the son of<br>Pandu.'<br><br>"Virata said, 'Whatever horses I have, I consign to thy care even from<br>today. And all the keepers of my horses and all my charioteers will from<br>today be subordinate to thee. If this suits thee, say what remuneration<br>is desired by thee. But, O thou that resemblest a celestial, the office<br>of equerry is not worthy of thee. For thou lookest like a king and I<br>esteem thee much. The appearance here hath pleased me as much as if<br>Yudhishthira himself were here. Oh, how does that blameless son of Pandu<br>dwell and divert himself in the forest, now destitute of servants as he<br>is.'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'That youth, like unto a chief of the<br>Gandharvas, was treated thus respectfully by the delighted king Virata.<br>And he conducted himself there in such a manner as to make himself dear<br>and agreeable to all in the palace. And no one recognised him while<br>living under Virata's protection. And it was in this manner then the sons<br>of Pandu, the very sight of whom had never been fruitless, continued to<br>live in the country of the Matsyas. And true to their pledge those lords<br>of the earth bounded by her belt of seas passed their days of incognito<br>with great composure notwithstanding their poignant sufferings.'"
