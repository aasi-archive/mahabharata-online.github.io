                    "Utanka said, 'I know thee, O Janarddana, to be the creator of the<br>universe. Without doubt, this knowledge that I have is the result of thy<br>grace towards me, O thou of unfading glory, my heart is possessed of<br>cheerful tranquillity in consequence of its being devoted to thee. Know,<br>O chastiser of foes, that my heart is no longer inclined to curse thee.<br>If, O Janarddana, I deserve the least grace from thee, do thou then show<br>me once thy sovereign form.'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'Gratified with him, the holy one then showed<br>Utanka that eternal Vaishnava form which Dhananjaya of great intelligence<br>had seen. Utanka beheld the high-souled Vasudeva's universal form, endued<br>with mighty arms. The effulgence of that form was like that of a blazing<br>fire of a thousand suns. It stood before him filling all space. It had<br>faces on every side. Beholding that high and wonderful Vaishnava form of<br>Vishnu, in act, seeing the Supreme Lord (in that guise), the Brahmana<br>Utanka became filled with wonder.'<br><br>"Utanka, said, 'O thou whose handiwork is the universe, I bow to thee, O<br>Soul of the universe, O parent of all things. With thy feet thou hast<br>covered the whole Earth, and with thy head thou fillest the firmament.<br>That which lies between the Earth and the firmament has been filled by<br>thy stomach. All the points of the compass are covered by thy arms. O<br>thou of unfading glory, thou art all this. Do thou withdraw this<br>excellent and indestructible form of thine. I wish to behold thee now in<br>thy own (human) form which too is eternal!'<br><br>"Vaisampayana continued, 'Unto him, O Janamejaya, Govinda of gratified<br>soul said these words,&#8212;'Do thou ask for some boon' Unto him Utanka,<br>however, said&#8212;Even this is a sufficient boon from thee for the present,<br>O thou of great splendour, in that, O Krishna, I have beheld this form of<br>thine, O foremost of all beings. Krishna, however, once more said unto<br>him&#8212;Do not scruple in this matter. This must be done. A sight of my form<br>cannot be fruitless.'<br><br>"Utanka said, 'I must accomplish that, O lord, which thou thinkest should<br>be done. I desire to have water wherever my wish for it may arise. Water<br>is scarce in such deserts.' Withdrawing that energy, the Supreme Lord<br>then said unto Utanka&#8212;Whenever thou wilt require water, think of me!<br>Having said so, he proceeded towards Dwaraka. Subsequently, one day, the<br>illustrious Utanka, solicitous of water and exceedingly thirsty, wandered<br>over the desert. In course of his wanderings he thought of Krishna of<br>unfading glory. The intelligent Rishi then beheld in that desert a naked<br>hunter (of the Chandala class), all besmeared with dirt, surrounded by a<br>pack of dogs. Extremely fierce-looking, he carried a sword and was armed<br>with bow and arrows. That foremost of regenerate ones beheld copious<br>streams of water issuing from the urinary organs of that hunter. As soon<br>as Utanka had thought of Krishna, that hunter smilingly addressed him,<br>saying,&#8212;'O Utanka, O thou of Bhrigu's race, do thou accept this water<br>from me. Beholding thee afflicted by thirst I have felt great compassion<br>for thee.' Thus addressed by the hunter, the ascetic showed no<br>inclination to accept that water. The intelligent Utanka even began to<br>censure Krishna of unfading glory. The hunter, how ever, repeatedly<br>addressed the Rishi, saying,&#8212;'Drink!' The ascetic refused to drink the<br>water thus offered. On the other hand, with heart afflicted by hunger and<br>thirst, he even gave way to wrath. Disregarded by the high-souled Rishi<br>through that conviction, the hunter, O king, with his pack of dogs,<br>disappeared there and then. Beholding that (wonderful) disappearance,<br>Utanka became filled with shame. He even thought that Krishna, that<br>slayer of foes, had beguiled him (in the matter of the boon he had<br>granted). Soon after, the holder of the conch and discus and mace, endued<br>with great intelligence, came to Utanka by the way (along which the<br>hunter had come). Addressing Krishna, the Brahmana said,&#8212;'O foremost of<br>beings, it was scarcely proper for thee to offer water unto foremost of<br>Brahmanas in the form of a hunter's urine, O lord.' Unto Utanka who said<br>these words, Janarddana of great intelligence replied, comforting him<br>with many soft words&#8212;'That form which it was proper to assume for<br>offering thee water, in that form was water offered to thee. But, also,<br>thou couldst not understand it. The wielder of the thunder bolt,<br>Purandara, was requested by me for thy sake. My words to that puissant<br>deity were&#8212;'Do thou give nectar in the form of water unto Utanka.' The<br>chief of the celestials replied to me saying&#8212;It is not proper that a<br>mortal should become immortal. Let some other boon be granted to<br>Utanka.'&#8212;O son of Bhrigu's race, these words were repeatedly addressed<br>to me. The lord of Sachi, however, was once more requested by me in these<br>words, viz., even nectar should be given to Utanka.'&#8212;The chief of the<br>celestials then, comforting me, said,&#8212;'If, O thou of great intelligence,<br>nectar is to be given to him, I shall then assume the form of a hunter<br>and give it to that high-souled descendant of Bhrigu's race. If that son<br>of Bhrigu accepts it thus, I then go to him, O lord, for giving it unto<br>him. If, however, he sends me away from disregard,&#8212;I shall not then give<br>it to him on any account,&#8212;Having made this compact with me, Vasava<br>appeared before thee, in that disguise, for giving thee nectar. Thou,<br>however, didst disregard him and send him away, seeing that the<br>illustrious one had put on the guise of a Chandala. Thy fault has been<br>great. Once more, with regard to thy desire, I am prepared to do what is<br>in my power. Indeed, this painful thirst of thine, I shall arrange, shall<br>be slaked. On those days, O regenerate one, in which thou wilt feel a<br>desire for water, clouds well-charged with water will rise over this<br>desert. Those clouds, O son of Bhrigu's race, will give thee savoury<br>water to drink. Verily, those clouds will become known in the world as<br>Utanka-clouds.' Thus addressed by Krishna, Utanka became filled with<br>gladness, and to this day, O Bharata, Utanka-clouds (appear and) shower<br>rain on and deserts.'"
