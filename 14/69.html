                            "Vaisampayana said, 'The helpless Uttara, desirous of getting back her<br>child, having indulged in these piteous lamentations, fell down in<br>affliction on the earth like a demented creature. Beholding the princess<br>fallen on the earth deprived of her son and with her body uncovered,<br>Kunti as also all the (other) Bharata ladies deeply afflicted, began to<br>weep aloud. Resounding with the voice of lamentation, the palace of the<br>Pandavas, O king, was soon converted into a mansion of sorrow where<br>nobody could remain. Exceedingly afflicted by grief on account of her<br>son, Virata's daughter, O king, seemed to be struck down for some time by<br>sorrow and cheerlessness. Regaining consciousness, O chief of Bharata's<br>race, Uttara took up her child on her lap and said these words: Thou art<br>the child of one who was conversant with every duty. Art thou not<br>conscious then of the sin thou committest, since thou dost not salute<br>this foremost one of the Vrishni's race? O son, repairing to thy sire<br>tell him these words of mine, viz.,&#8212;it is difficult for living creatures<br>to die before their time comes, since though reft of thee, my husband,<br>and now deprived of my child also, I am yet alive when I should die,<br>unendued as I am with everything auspicious and everything possessed of<br>value.&#8212;O mighty-armed one, with the permission of king Yudhishthira the<br>just I shall swallow some virulent poison or cast myself on the blazing<br>fire. O sire, difficult of destruction is my heart since, though I am<br>deprived of husband and child, that heart of mine does not yet break into<br>a thousand pieces. Rise, O son and behold this thy afflicted<br>great-grandmother. She is deeply afflicted with grief, bathed in tears,<br>exceedingly cheerless, and plunged in an ocean of sorrow. Behold the<br>reverend princess of Panchala, and the helpless princess of the Satwata<br>race. Behold myself, exceedingly afflicted with grief, and resembling a<br>deer pierced by a hunter. Rise, O child, and behold the face of this lord<br>of the worlds, that is endued with great wisdom, and possessed of eyes<br>like lotus-petals and resembling thy sire of restless glance. Beholding<br>Uttara, who indulged in these lamentations, fallen on the earth, all<br>those ladies, raising her, caused her to sit up. Having sat up, the<br>daughter of the king of the Matsyas, summoning her patience, joined her<br>hands in reverence and touched the earth with her head for saluting<br>Kesava of eyes like the petals of the lotus. That foremost of beings,<br>hearing those heart-rending lamentations of hers, touched water and<br>withdrew the (force of the) Brahma-weapon.<span class="footnote-tooltip" style="color:rgb(255,193,7);"><sup><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i></sup><span class="footnote-tooltip-text">Before performing any rite or act of a grave nature, Hindus are required to touch water or perform what is called the 'achamana'. A little quantity of water is taken on the palm of the right hand, and with it are touched the lips, the nostrils, the ears, and the eyes.  </span></span> That hero of unfading<br>glory, belonging to the race of the Dasarhas, promised to give the child<br>his life. Then he of pure soul, said these words in the hearing of the<br>whole universe,&#8212;'O Uttara, I never utter an untruth. My words will prove<br>true. I shall revive this child in the presence of all creatures. Never<br>before have I uttered an untruth even in jest. Never have I turned back<br>from battle. (By the merit of those acts) let this child revive! As<br>righteousness is dear to me, as Brahmanas are specially dear to me, (by<br>the merit of that disposition of mine) let Abhimanyu's son, who is born<br>dead, revive! Never hath a misunderstanding arisen between me and my<br>friend Vijaya. Let this dead child revive by that truth! As truth and<br>righteousness are always established in me, let this dead child of<br>Abhimanyu revive (by the merit of these)! As Kansa and Kesi have been<br>righteously slain by me, let this child revive today by that truth!'<br>After these words were uttered by Vasudeva, that child, O foremost one of<br>Bharata's race, became animate and began gradually to move, O monarch.'
