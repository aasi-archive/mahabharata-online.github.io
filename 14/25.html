                    "The Brahmana said, 'In this connection is recited the ancient story of<br>what the institution is of the Chaturhotra (sacrifice). The ordinances<br>are now being duly declared of that in its entirety. Listen to me, O<br>amiable lady, as I declare this wonderful mystery. The agent, the<br>instrument, the action and Emancipation,&#8212;these, O beautiful lady, are<br>the four sacrificing priests by whom the universe is enveloped. Hear in<br>its entirety the assignment of causes (relating to this topic). The nose,<br>the tongue, the eye, the skin, the ear numbering the fifth, the mind, and<br>the understanding,&#8212;these seven should be understood as being caused by<br>(the knowledge of) qualities. Smell, taste, colour, sound, touch,<br>numbering the fifth, the objects of the mind, and the objects of the<br>understanding, these seven are caused by action. He who smells, he who<br>eats, he who sees, he who speaks, he who hears, numbering the fifth, he<br>who thinks, and he who understands&#8212;these seven should be known as caused<br>by the agent. Possessed of qualities, these enjoy their own qualities,<br>agreeable or disagreeable.<span class="footnote-tooltip" style="color:rgb(255,193,7);"><sup><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i></sup><span class="footnote-tooltip-text">'These' refers to action, agent and instrument. The qualities of which they are possessed are goodness, passion, and darkness.  </span></span> As regards the Soul, that is destitute of<br>qualities. These seven are the causes of Emancipation. With them that are<br>learned and possessed of sufficient understanding, the qualities, which<br>are in the position of deities, eat the oblations, each in its proper<br>place, and agreeably to what has been ordained. The person who is<br>destitute of learning, eating diverse kind of food, becomes seized with<br>the sense of mineness.<span class="footnote-tooltip" style="color:rgb(255,193,7);"><sup><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i></sup><span class="footnote-tooltip-text">What is stated in these two verses is this: it is the Senses that enjoy; and not the Soul. This is well known to those that are learned. On the other hand, those that are not learned, regard this or that to be theirs, when in reality they are different from them. They are their selves, and not their senses, although they take themselves for the latter, ignorantly identifying themselves with things which they are not.  </span></span> Digesting food for himself, he becomes ruined<br>through the sense of mineness. The eating of food that should not be<br>eaten, and the drinking of wine, ruin him. He destroys the food (he<br>takes), and having destroyed that food, he becomes destroyed himself. The<br>man of learning, however, being possessed of puissance, destroys his food<br>for reproducing it. The minutest transgression does not arise in him from<br>the food he takes. Whatever is thought of by the mind, whatever is<br>uttered by speech, whatever is heard by the ear, whatever is seen by the<br>eye, whatever is touched by the (sense of) touch, whatever is smelt by<br>the nose, constitute oblations of clarified butter which should all,<br>after restraining the senses with the mind numbering the sixth, be poured<br>into that fire of high merits which burns within the body, viz., the<br>Soul.<span class="footnote-tooltip" style="color:rgb(255,193,7);"><sup><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i></sup><span class="footnote-tooltip-text">What is stated here is this: Restraining the senses and the mind, the objects of those senses and the mind should be poured as libations on the sacred fire of the Soul that is within the body.  </span></span> The sacrifice constituted by Yoga is going on as regards<br>myself. The spring whence that sacrifice proceeds is that which yields<br>the fire of knowledge. The upward life-wind Prana is the Stotra of that<br>sacrifice. The downward life-wind Apana is its Sastra. The renunciation<br>of everything is the excellent Dakshina of that sacrifice. Consciousness,<br>Mind, and Understanding&#8212;these becoming Brahma, are its Hotri, Adhwaryyu,<br>and Udgatri. The Prasastri, his Sastra, is truth.<span class="footnote-tooltip" style="color:rgb(255,193,7);"><sup><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i></sup><span class="footnote-tooltip-text">i.e., truth is the Sastra of the Prasastri.  </span></span> Cessation of<br>separate existence (or Emancipation) is the Dakshina. In this connection,<br>people conversant with Narayana recite some Richs. Unto the divine<br>Narayana were animals offered in days of yore.<span class="footnote-tooltip" style="color:rgb(255,193,7);"><sup><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i></sup><span class="footnote-tooltip-text">Narayana is taken by Nilakantha to stand here for either the Veda or the Soul. The animals offered up to Narayana in days of old were the senses offered up as sacrifices.  </span></span> Then are sung some<br>Samanas. On that topic occurs an authority. O timid one, know that the<br>divine Narayana is the soul of all.'"
