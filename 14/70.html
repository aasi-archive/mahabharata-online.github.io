                    "Vaisampayana said, 'When the Brahma-weapon was withdrawn by Krishna, at<br>that time, the laying-in room was illumined by thy father with his<br>energy. All the Rakshasas (that had come there) were forced to leave the<br>room and many of them met with destruction. In the welkin a voice was<br>heard, saying, 'Excellent, O Kesava, Excellent!'&#8212;The blazing<br>Brahma-weapon then returned to the Grandsire (of all the worlds). Thy<br>sire got back his life-breaths, O king. The child began to move according<br>to his energy and might. The Bharata ladies became filled with joy. At<br>the command of Govinda, the Brahmanas were made to utter benedictions.<br>All the ladies, filled with joy, praised Janarddana. Indeed, the wives of<br>those Bharata lions, viz., Kunti and Drupada's daughter and Subhadra, and<br>Uttara, and the wives of other lions among men, like (ship-wrecked)<br>persons who have reached the shore after having obtained a boat, became<br>exceedingly glad. Then wrestlers and actors and astrologers and those who<br>enquire after the slumbers (of princes), and bands of bards and eulogists<br>all uttered the praises of Janarddana, while uttering benedictions<br>fraught with the praises of the Kuru race, O chief of the Bharatas.<br>Uttara, rising up at the proper time, with a delighted heart and bearing<br>her child in her arms, reverentially saluted the delighter of the Yadus.<br>Rejoicing greatly, Krishna made gifts unto the child of many valuable<br>gems. The other chiefs of the Vrishni race, did the same. Then the<br>puissant Janarddana, firmly adhering to truth, bestowed a name on the<br>infant who was thy sire, O monarch.&#8212;'Since this child of Abhimanyu has<br>been born at a time when this race has become nearly extinct, let his<br>name be Parikshit!' Even this is what he said. Then thy father, O king,<br>began to grow, and gladden all the people, O Bharata. When thy father was<br>a month old, O hero, the Pandavas came back to their capital, bringing<br>with them a profusion of wealth. Hearing that the Pandavas were near,<br>those foremost ones of the Vrishni race went out. The citizens decked the<br>city called after the elephant with garlands of flowers in profusions,<br>with beautiful pennons and standards of diverse kinds. The citizens also,<br>O king, adorned their respective mansions. Desirous of doing what was<br>beneficial to the sons of Pandu, Vidura ordered diverse kinds of worship<br>to be offered to the deities established in their respective temples. The<br>principal streets of the city were adorned with flowers. Indeed, the city<br>was filled with the hum of thousands of voices which resembled the<br>softened roar of distant ocean waves. With dancers all engaged in their<br>vocation, and with the voice of singers, the (Kuru) city then resembled<br>the mansion of Vaisravana himself.<span class="footnote-tooltip" style="color:rgb(255,193,7);"><sup><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i></sup><span class="footnote-tooltip-text">The abode of Vaisravana is called Alaka. Vaisravana is, of course, Kuvera, the lord of treasures, friend of Mahadeva, and chief of the Yakshas.  </span></span> Bards and eulogists, O king,<br>accompanied by beautiful women were seen to adorn diverse retired spots<br>in the city. The pennons were caused by the wind to float gaily on every<br>part of the city, as if bent upon showing the Kurus the southern and the<br>northern points of the compass. All the officers also of the government<br>loudly proclaimed that that was to be a day of rejoicing for the entire<br>kingdom as an indication of the success of the enterprise for bringing a<br>profusion of gems and other valuables.'"<span class="footnote-tooltip" style="color:rgb(255,193,7);"><sup><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i></sup><span class="footnote-tooltip-text">The last line is slightly expanded.  </span></span>
