                    Vaisampayana said, "When Vyasa of wonderful achievements had concluded<br>his speech to the king, the highly-puissant son of Vasudeva (Krishna)<br>also addressed him. Knowing the king, the son of Pritha, afflicted in<br>mind, and bereft of his relatives and kinsmen slain in battle, and<br>appearing crest-fallen like the sun darkened eclipse, or fire smothered<br>by smoke, that prop of the Vrishni race (Krishna), comforting the son of<br>Dharma, essayed to address him thus."<br><br>Vasudeva said, "All crookedness of heart leads to destruction<br>(perdition?) and all rectitude leads to Brahman (spiritual excellence).<br>If this and this only is the aim and object of all true wisdom, then what<br>can mental distraction do (to one who understands this)? Thy Karma has<br>not yet been annihilated, nor have thy enemies been subjugated, for thou<br>dost not yet know the enemies that are still lurking within thine own<br>flesh. I shall (therefore) relate to thee truly as I have heard it, the<br>story of the war of Indra with Vritra as it took place. In ancient times<br>the Prithivi (earth), O king, was encompassed by Vritra, and by this<br>abstraction of earthly matter, the seat of all odour, there arose bad<br>odours on all sides, and the Performer of a hundred sacrifices (Indra),<br>being much enraged by this act, hurled his thunderbolt at Vritra. And<br>being deeply wounded by the thunderbolt of mighty Indra, Vritra entered<br>into the (waters), and by doing so he destroyed their property. The<br>waters being seized by Vritra, their liquid property left them. At this<br>Indra became highly enraged and again smote him with his thunderbolt. And<br>he (Vritra) smitten by the thunderbolt by the most powerful Indra betook<br>himself to the Jyoti (luminous matter) and abstracted its inherent<br>property. The luminous matter being overwhelmed by Vritra and its<br>property, colour and form being thereby lost, the wrathful Indra again<br>hurled his thunderbolt at him. And thus wounded again by Indra of<br>immeasurable power, Vritra entered all on a sudden into the Vayu (gaseous<br>matter). and thereafter made away with its inherent property. And this<br>matter being overpowered by Vritra and its property, viz., touch being<br>lost, Indra became again filled with wrath and flung his thunderbolt at<br>him. And wounded therein by the mighty (Indra), he overwhelmed the Akasa<br>(ether), and took away its inherent property, and the Akasa being<br>overwhelmed by Vritra, and its property, sound being destroyed, the god<br>of a hundred sacrifices highly incensed, again smote him with his<br>thunderbolt. And thus smitten by the mighty Indra, he suddenly entered<br>into his (Sakra's) body, and took away its essential attributes. And<br>overtaken by Vritra, he was filled with great illusion. And, O venerable<br>sir, the mightiest of Bharata's race, we have heard that Vasistha<br>comforted Indra (when he was thus afflicted) and that the god of a<br>hundred sacrifices slew Vritra in his body by means of his invisible<br>thunderbolt, and know, O prince, that this religious mystery was recited<br>by Sakra to the great sages, and they in turn told it to me."
